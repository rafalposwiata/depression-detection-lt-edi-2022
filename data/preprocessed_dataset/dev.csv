dev_pid_4407,"I feel so empty : I just broke up with my boyfriend and I feel nothing, I cried but felt nothing. There was no passion on my side, I miss that passion, that obsession.
Once I gave a guy 5 bucks for him to kiss me, I used to be obsessed with that guy, and I think that if I see him again my feelings will grow again, but he was an asshole, a homeless bipolar schizophrenic asshole, and I loved it. I could relate to him, see his mental struggle. I would tell all the reasons I liked him but that's not the point.
The point is, it's not healthy to be obsessed, I think I just want to have a distraction, something to distract my heart. 
Idk what to do with my life, I'm doing nothing atm, I don't go to school, I don't have a job, I spend most of my time home (I'm doing exams to do 12th grade but didn't study shit yet) and I'm depressed and lonely and empty. But tbh, I kinda like feeling those things, it makes me feel truly like a human being, if I was a character from a movie or tv show, I think I would be my favorite character.
I think I wanna write a book about my life and my struggles but depression doesn't let me, I like to write and I can be good at it, but for some reason, I never ended a single story, why? Idk, maybe i get bored, or lack ideas, maybe I'm just shit at writing.
I really think I wanna write a book about my life and as always, that is a distraction but I wanna do it, I need distractions or I'll go crazy, maybe I'll never end it, probably I won't since I started 20 + stories and finished none but I still have faith I'll finish something.
But for that I would need to organize my ideas, with a psychologist, I talked with my mom to come back to one, and I think I want her to help me write my book, to organize my ideas.
Idk why I made this post, I think I just wanna hear you guys' thoughts on this and your experiences, idk if anyone will respond but I'll really appreciate if you did.

dev_pid_4408,"How to cope after decades of depression and no viable hope for the future? : Hello!
I feel a bit of background story is in order.
I've been with depression and GAD since I was about 15 (I turn 33 this year).  
Sometimes it gets a little better, sometimes it gets a little worse.
Except now it's a lot worse.  
Not the worst, but heading there.
I cannot seem to cope these days, thoughts of ending it all are frequent, no matter how much I talk to my therapist (I do talk therapy and have medications), no matter how much I read self-help articles, I take my pills as prescribed, nothing is helping.  
My therapist says that not having enough money is a major trigger for me, which is true, since I grew up poor and am now struggling to make ends meet.
Does anyone have any advice on how to pick myself up when everything around me is broken or sellotaped together? Nothing works and I have no money to fix it...
I am not a materialistic person, I just think I've hit my limit at how much I can take...
For a bit more background: I (F, 32) live in a studio apartment that my grandmother left me, it is legally mine, so I don't pay rent, only property taxes twice a year. I am unemployed and looking for a job for about a year now, but nobody wants to hire me. I live off of what I make by baking cakes for people and babysitting for neighbours. I am not poor, but I think the situation of not seeing a way out of this day-to-day living is getting to me.
I feel so worthless and helpless, pathetic and sad...  
I am willing to work, I promise, only nobody wants to hire me...
I apologise if something doesn't make much sense, I feel jumbled and English is not my first language. Not an excuse, but just know it's not intentional.
Thank you to all in advance, xx",0
dev_pid_4409,"How to gain (healthy) weight when in a depression : I am a little underweight so I want to start working out and gain muscle. I have a fast metabolism so I know I must need to eat a huge surplus of food. Right now I only eat one real meal a day and then some vending machine chips.
You see I work overnights. So I get home at 6:30 am and I'd rather smoke weed and relax than make breakfast. Plus my parents and sister are still sleeping. So I grab an apple or granola bar and go upstairs. Then I might come down around 10 or 11 and eat a small real meal. It might be tacos or pasta or maybe a steak. But usually not a super huge meal. Then I'll go to sleep and wake up just in time to go to work, where I eat a couple bags of chips all night. I really dont know what to make to bring to lunch. My parents dont keep the fridge stocked that well but I have money to go shopping if I need to.
I'm just so depressed I cant force myself to cook and idk when to even cook or what to cook. All the recipes I look up are so damn involved. What do i do besides getting on pharmaceuticals because i will not do that due to my body type.",0
dev_pid_4410,"Much happier girl now? : Hi guys, for the last couple years I was super depressed and it was hard finding people to talk to because they would not see it as a problem, either girls would tell me they wish they had that problem or guys would contribute to the problem for the most part. 
I don’t want come off as narcissist but people find me very attractive and my larger chest area doesn’t help. I realized since I was perhaps a freshman in high school. Senior guys inviting me to parties, male teachers giving me special privileges and occasionally their eyes would wander away from my face. I didn’t really see a huge problem until I got to college. I wanted to date, find a nice guy to treat me right and I found it was super hard. 
The majority of guys that I talked to weren’t looking for anything more than a hookup. Some guys respected the fact that I didn’t want a hookup but the majority of guys would go along and pretend to want more when in reality they didn’t. When I would ask to get to know each other more before we do anything, I’d be called a tease, accused of leading them on and told hurtful stuff like “I’m sure other guys have been in your pants, why can’t I get some” do you know how hurtful that is. And eventually, complements meant nothing to me, I’d get so many and they all felt sexual in nature. They were all based off my looks and nothing more. 
Guys with girlfriends were a lot of times the worst, if they saw me talking to their boyfriends, they’d get super jealous, if we’re studying for a test together, they assumed I’m trying to take their man. I would never try to get in between someone’s relationship and if your boyfriend decides to flirt with me, I’ll do my best to make him know I’m not interested but I’m not responsible for his actions so don’t get upset at me. And a lot of girls would just seem to be in competition with me and I’m not. Or some of them would make it seem as if they are worshiping me and it just felt weird. 
Then things got worst how people assumed things I get stuff based off my looks strictly. Like I’m not going to lie people have given me special treatment but I’ve never requested it and I’ve never depended on it, I’ve always been dedicated to working hard and earning what I want. I remember my sophomore year I was taking a Number Theory class which is harder than it sounds. I took a test, the mean score was about a 55% and I got a 91% and a girl claimed I got a high grade based of my looks. I studied hard for that, I tried to get a group together where she was invited and she declined. On my test, the problems were done correctly, and she claimed it was based of my looks. That was just so hurtful. 
As time went on it just bothered, and I became depressed off of it based off the idea that I did not think I could ever find love. I’m a start girl, pretty but I felt like I could not find a guy to talk to where the topic of sex or my boobs did not come up before a couple conversions. It just felt like that’s all guys saw me for. And I know looks fade as time go, I don’t want a guy who just has sex with me then goes and brags to his friends, or realizes that I won’t always be this pretty and move on to another girl eventually. And I could not talk to people. Girls would always say they wish they had that as a problem, and guys would always “listen” and the next week they’re asking for pictures of my breast. And my family didn’t make things better either always asking why I don’t have a boyfriend, it must be so easy for me. 
That just always bothered me and brought me down significantly, I was never in a great state of depression but it was something that was just there and it was hard to talk to someone. That was something that bothered me until last year. 
One day my car battery died at school and a friend and I were outside for about thirty minutes trying to jumpstart it. But she drove a weird Jeep and you had to unscrew stuff to get to the battery so we were there for a while. Eventually this guy came but and asked if we needed help, he has a portable battery in his car. I assumed he was just another guy trying to get into my pants. But that was not the case. He came over and actually helped, he knew what he was doing. We talked a bit afterwards, found out we used to live in the same area. He’s a volunteer firefighter in the town over now and he’s an economics major with a math minor. Then he said he had to go, he didn’t get my name or ask for my Snapchat like most guys do. 
There was just something about him, the way he was super kind to do this gesture for me without expecting nothing in return. I was somewhat attracted to him. Luckily, I started seeing him on campus all the time and we would wave to each other. Eventually I got brave enough to go and talk to him and I did. We became friends and started talking a lot, he was super kind, funny and a weird sense of charisma. And I started realizing just how handsome he was along with his super muscular bodies. One thing led to another and we have been dating since then. This man treat me right, makes me so happy, makes me feel cared for and for much more than my body. Every conversation is not just about sex, he actually listen to me. Asks about my dreams and aspirations and I feel so comfortable around him. Every once in a while I do catch his eye wandering away but with him, I do enjoy it and sometimes his eyes would stay there a bit longer after I catch him haha. His complements mean much more to me, because they feel genuine and much more than something to get into my pants. I love this guy a lot, and I generally don’t advocate for getting into relationships to fix depression. But I’m this specific case it helped me, I’m so happy with him and I could see us lasting and I would like it to and he feels the same. But at the same time I do know that if for some unfortunate reason we don’t work out at the very least there are great guys out there.",0
dev_pid_4411,"I don’t know how to help her. : My friend told most of our friend group that she’s depressed and this happens all the time. She likes a boy, they reject her, then she comes back to school really depressed, saying things like “I wanna die” and when she IS in a good mood, she makes suicidal jokes that aren’t funny because we don’t know whether she’s serious or not. Whenever she makes a joke like that or talks about her problems, everyone’s happy mood disappears. I don’t think it’s bad to vent, but I just think there’s a right time for everything. When we’re talking about funny stories together, you don’t all of a sudden say, “Haha yeah, I wanna die.” Instead of telling EVERYONE, tell one person you think will help the most, “Hey, can we talk privately?” Because not everyone knows how to deal with your problem and will instead make them feel like it’s their fault you’re not feeling better. I don’t wanna tell ANYONE who is depressed this because I have a feeling it’ll just make them feel worse.
I’ve been trying to help her, telling her to take a break from dating, but I feel like my words never reach her and it just makes me feel bad that she hasn’t progressed. Yes, I will carry the burden with her and help, but when I see that carrying the burden and helping her isn’t making her feel any better, I get depressed as well.
She won’t tell me what to do to make her feel better, and when I do tell her how to feel better, she just keeps doing what makes her feel bad: Dating.

Has anyone here gone through that, what advice can you give me?",0
dev_pid_4414,"I don't know how to cope anymore : I've been diagnosed with chronic depression at the age of 10. I am 21 now and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder too a few years back.
In the past it wasn't so difficult to go through the day because I had school and was busy all the time. Apart from my social anxiety and awkwardness I still had friends and a semi normal life. My strict parents did prevent me from doing things with my friends. So I ended up losing most of them when I got out of school.
I ended up dating a guy (my first official bf) for almost 2 years, we broke up last year. It left me in pieces and I'm still not over it. I can't connect to anyone emotionally anymore (guys). Also, my best friend got into a friend's with benefits relationship and kept choosing him above me even though I was there every time he hurt her. She chased me away when I wanted to spend time with her so she can be with him. So I decided, because of this continuous toxic behaviour I am not going to put in any effort to be her friend anymore.
I overthink a lot. I get angry easily. I cut people off very easily. And I know it's my own fault that I'm losing people around me. I know I'm a shitty person. I hate myself. I don't know how to cope anymore people around me because I feel like eventually they see what a bad person I am and just leave me. I have just always felt like I don't deserve to have people in my life that care. That supports me. I've always done everything on my own. The only people that I do believe support me are my parents, my brother and some other family members.
I have tried to commit suicide multiple times. I think about it on a daily basis. I can't see myself having a normal future so what's the point of living. How do you live with yourself if you're toxic on the inside and all you do is self criticize, self hate, dislike people and see everything negatively.
I get up in the morning and I'm fine but somehow I just keep losing myself more and more each day.
I try making myself happy by being financially independent to a degree, having a job, having my own pet, starting my studies soon. But at the end of the day all the bad things end up bothering me so much and I make everything seem so much worse than it probably is. 
And I have seen therapists but I simply can't afford it and it doesn't seem to help anymore because my depression keeps changing and evolving. 
Sorry for the long post...
Tl;dr: I'm majorly depressed and I don't know how to cope with practically no more friends left, a strong hatred for myself and a tendency to overthink and catastrophize everything. Yes I've seen therapists.",0

dev_pid_4416,"My long-term, live-in partner and I both struggle with depression. Now he is asking for physical space. How do I support him and not take it personally? : To preface, we’ve been together 5 years. We have a dog and a house and a life. We’re not married, but we’ve both expressed growing old together and living out our lives together.
My depression is just kind of like a backpack I pick up and wear every day. Sometimes it’s heavy, but other days it’s just there holding my shit. My partner, on the other hand, was under the impression that he was the worlds most capable, happy, fulfilled dude, but has recently discovered that he is in the bout of a debilitating depression.
His friendships are fragmented, his family is dealing with some heavy shit, his job is taking a severe toll on him and I’ll admit that my depression backpack has been very fucking heavy lately. Honestly, the man has a right to be exhausted. Especially since he’s so unfamiliar with the “boundaries” word.
Yesterday (or two days ago? I haven’t slept or eaten in days as a result.) he told me that he needed physical space to work this out on his own. My higher, more reasonable and logical self understands this. I am currently on a plane back from a 10-day solo vacation I took for the exact same reason. My fragile, insecure, depressed ego, on the other hand, is terrified. I’m finding another place to stay, but he can’t tell me when he’ll feel ok with me “coming home” again. 
He is devastated. He sobbed on the phone with me for hours telling me he was sorry, that he doesn’t want to hurt me, he doesn’t know why he’s just learning these things, he doesn’t know why he’s like this, etc.
For a couple of weeks, the “I love yous” have been few and far between. Why? 6 weeks ago it was, “You’re my queen. You’re my person. We’re the best team. I love you I love you I love you I love you.”
I am spiraling. Higher self says “this is just a vacation” and fragile self says “he doesn’t love you anymore and he’ll just keep retreating from you.”
I want to support him. I am in this to win it. How can I support him and support myself at the same time? How can I implement boundaries during this time that make us both feel secure? How can I stop seeing this as a sign that my relationship is over? Does he not love me anymore?
TLDR, My boyfriend is depressed and wants to live apart for an undisclosed amount of time and I am spiraling please for the love of god help me gain some perspective.

dev_pid_4417,"I am demolishing myself : For the past 3 years Ive been isolating myself and separated myself from everybody.  It started when i began smoking weed, I just quit a month or two ago and now that I’ve exited this 3 year delusional daze that ive been in, I’m a social wreck.

I will go weeks without talking to anybody and im even awkward around my family, the persistent sadness and emptiness I feel from losing everybody around me mixed with an uncertainty for the future leaves me feeling so socially debilitated that I could just stand there in a daze while someone tries to talk to me, and I really dont know what to do at all.

dev_pid_4420,"I will kill myself within 2 days : I will turn 18 this Tuesday. I gave myself enough time. Nothing happened. I've tried reaching out and seeking help. People don't really care. Even if they say they do, they never show it in action. I posted another cry for help on Reddit before (with another account) but moderators deleted it for no reason before someone even replies. I've tried therapy, psychiatrists didn't help. In fact, opening up to people actually made it worse. I just want people to consider my mental condition and treat me better instead of giving me advice. But at least after therapy I know that I have Autism, Psychotic Depression, Anxiety, Schizophrenia, OCD, Maladaptive Daydreaming Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. I think I have Dissociative Identity Disorder. I know what is happening when one of my other personalities is controlling me, but I have no control over what thay say or what they do. One of my psychiatrists said I'm just ""too schizophrenic"". I can't communicate with people. I can't have long lasting friendships. I have never felt loved and I don't even know what it means or feels like. I don't feel empathy or sympathy.
I gave myself time to think about this. I realized something: I don't want to just end the pain, I don't want to live. I'm tired of waking up and trying to survive the day just to do the same repetitive things that I do everyday. I don't want a job, I don't want money, I don't want to graduate. I seriously don't want anything from life. But that's not the worst part. I live in Iran. In Iran when guys turn 18 they have to go to military academy for 2 years (or you can keep graduating and then go to military academy after you're done, but it's a rule and you can't escape from it). I can't even imagine 2 years without my PC. After all it's one of the things that kept me alive. I wish I could live in another country, but that needs a lot of money and I have to take IELTS test and go to military academy anyway. Otherwise I'm stuck here. Hold on a second... If I live in another country I need a job, so it would be pointless.
The other thing that kept (or maybe keeps) me alive is my daydreaming. Real life is very boring and repetitive. If I could live in my daydreaming forever, it would be nice. Something like a different world which I could live in. People in my daydreams are all fictional characters and I like them more than real life people. That's why I can't just quit it and go find real friends. They actually helped me a bit with their emotional support.
There is no other way. Nothing will change if I stay alive, and I can't change anything myself. No matter how hard I try, no matter how much I want it, the story of my life doesn't have a good ending. I wanted to give myself 1 more year, but that's just pointless. I will kill myself on my birthday.
Now don't tell me I have so much to live for, everything will be okay, it will end someday. Tell me whatever you think is actually helpful. Only if my post won't be deleted like before.",0

i’m going to keep this part straightforward. i was 13, my sister was 17, the night started with me trying to calm my sister who was hysterically crying in the midst of a panic attack while my parents slept in the next room over. i calmed her down. she told me she thought her friend had killed themself because they hadn’t responded to her text. she said she would never kill herself because she didn’t want me to feel how she felt. what happened between this moment and the morning are fuzzy. i went to bed, and woke up to a note from my parents telling me to call them.
my sister overdosed on pills that night. she was seizing in the hospital, had to be restrained to the table with a tube down her throat. i can’t express how traumatic it was to visit her the next day, she was screaming for her life, her eyes manically darting around the room as if some monster invisible to the rest of us was tormenting her. she begged the nurses to let her die. 
[to my sister, i’m sorry if you find this i never ever blamed you, i don’t resent you i love you]",0
dev_pid_4429,"""Laziness"" : Hello  beautiful people. I've been diagnosed with moderate depression 6 years  ago and was put on medication. 3-4 years later I moved out from home. I  seemed to have recovered by then. So treatment stopped. It was not  entirely abrupt, but the weaning-off procedure was not medically ""ideal""  either, because I rather took matters into my own hand.
The main one being: I  become ""lazy"", everything costs me enormous amounts of energy. I haven't  really cleaned my flat for 5 months. The laundry is piling on. I do the  absolute minimum of my responsibilities, sometimes not even that.  Personal hygiene goes out the window.  Indifference kicks in.",0
dev_pid_4430,"Random question, but who here feels like you almost want to be depressed, and you feel bad for not being as depressed as others? : I've personally been on anti-depressants for about three months and they haven't done anything apart from just make me physically incapable of feeling depressed. And that's not a good thing. Depression breaks through sometimes, but it's really rare.
I don't really know why, but it's almost like I miss feeling sad. I miss never being happy. I miss being able to think about me dying, and it's weirdly hard to do that now I'm on medication. And the fact that I miss that just terrifies me. I mean, I always knew that I was a really horrible person, but was I seriously faking being depressed all this time just so I could feel special, or so I didn't have to take responsibility for my laziness and just other shitty qualities? Sometimes when I'm feeling good (for my standards) about myself I think that I am actually depressed and that me thinking I'm not is just a symptom of depression but I have my doubts about that. I don't know, I'm just so confused right now.
And then on places like this subreddit, I read about people who are really suffering and I feel like shit for not exhibiting the exact same symptoms that they do. I know there is a massive amount of different types of depression and nobody will have the same experiences, but it's almost like I use every single scrap of evidence to try to prove to myself that I've been faking it and I'm a terrible person and all of that crap. And then I feel bad for thinking that it's me just cherry-picking evidence because deep down I know that I am faking it and it's just me trying to justify it by cherry-picking evidence about me cherry-picking evidence and.... i don't even know. I feel like my brain is just completely broken
Anyway, sorry for making you read all that incoherent garbage lol. But I was honestly just wondering if anybody else here has these kind of thoughts, like you're faking it all just for attention, and the fact that you don't have every single possible symptom of depression and mental illnesses in general makes you feel bad. But to be honest, it is probably just me",0
dev_pid_4431,"Antidepressant not working? : Hey I am a 25 year old man who has struggled with anxiety and depression for all my life. It would take too long to tell you about all the issues I've faced but in summary I suffer from OCD, BDD, GAD and physical pain (most notably severe nerve pain in my left arm) which has caused me to become anxious and depressed.
In December 2019 I finally realized that this was not gonna go away by itself and all the therapy talks and CBT was not helping. I went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed Lexapro which I was on for 5 weeks (first 2 weeks I was on 5 mg/day, and then 10 mg/day). I didn't really develop a good rapport with this psychiatrist so I changed to another one who I really like. On lexapro I felt that my mood was elevated and even my anxiety/depression started to improve a little but the effect was kinda shortlived and because of sexual side effects (took forever to ejaculate) and fatigue, my psychiatrist recommended me to switch to another medication called Trintellix (Vortioxetine).
I quit lexapro cold turkey and started Trintellix 10mg/day instead. Once again I felt my mood elevate and anxiety/depression improve but after 2 weeks I was back to baseline and a week after that I increased my dose to 15 mg/day and the same thing happened again - 2 good weeks then back to baseline. I've been on Trintellix 15 mg/day for three weeks now and I mentally feel pretty bad honestly. I don't have sexual side effects which is great, although I suffer from erection pain due to a botched circumcision (hopefully will do some foreskin restoration to get more skin and decrease pain in the future - need surgery first to remove scarring). I still am tired and have issues with concentration which isn't great since I am in medical school (although I am on medical leave now - but I was thinking long term it would be a problem.) What is bothering me most though at the moment is the pain I suffer in my arm which was caused by a bothed blood draw (basically the nurse hit a nerve in my arm and more than three years later I am still in pain - I know I'm not the luckiest guy alive haha...). Due to my OCD and general frustration I actually aggravated that injury by constantly pushing and aggressively stretching out my arm - stopped with that now but yeah I made the situation worse.
The Trintellix has helped with anxiety but everyday I am in pain and it's weighing heavily on my mind besides hurting a lot. I would say it's the biggest contributing factor to my depression and it makes me devoid of energy and I have no will to do anything - the only relief I get is when I am in my bed or sleeping. I've tried to keep up the hope that it will go away but after three years it's unlikely. My psychiatrist said I needed to accept my injury and the pain but how do I do that? I read online about treatments for nerve pain and the antidepressant amitriptyline came up often but it seems to have so many side effects... and as strange as it sounds I don't like the idea of medicating against the pain - I want it to go away by itself.
In summary I am in a bad place not really knowing what the next step should be. I was planning on going up to 20 mg/day which is max dose for Trintellix and perhaps combining that medication with a stimulant like Modafinil which doesn't seem to interact with Trintellix, which adderall, ritalin, vyvanse etc... seem to do, in order to combat my fatigue and concentration issues. What do you think of this plan? I feel the big issue is the nerve pain but I don't know if you can even treat that? Any other tips for me?

dev_pid_4440,"First time experiencing depression and don’t know how to handle it : Hey. I’ll try to sum things up. In the beginning of 2018 my grandmother committed suicide and my whole family took it hard, especially my father. He spiraled as soon as it happened and almost went down the same path. I shut off — couldn’t read (which I love), couldn’t study, couldn’t work, and it was senior year. 
Thankfully I did get into college but I’m a year in and it has been terrible. Still can’t study, failed a bunch of classes and hate my major. I have been getting worse and worse, so about 6 months ago I started therapy (I know, should have started as soon as it happened). It has been nice but the progress is very slow. I don’t feel like myself anymore and everything I used to love doing doesn’t feel nice anymore. 
The one thing I can still keep up with and that makes me happy is interacting with my horse. He is pretty much the love of my life and everything I do is about him (including what I decided to major on). However, he got sick for the 100th time (he is very sensitive) and the vets are saying he will have to retire and might lose quality of life. This was last week and it completely broke me. To top it off, my mother has always been my rock, but lately our relationship is terrible and I have never felt more alone. 
I don’t feel comfortable reaching out to friends, I barely leave the house and I’m feeling utterly useless and broken. I have exactly 0 hope that things will get better and my mood ranges from wanting to kill everyone to crying in a corner.

This person meant the world to me. Their family did too. I was able to work through my depression by talking to, spending time with, and feeling a part of something. I’ve also been in love with this person for a long time. However, in my selfless ways, I never let that be a complication. Until recent I found out they were terribly unhappy in their marriage for many different reasons. I was here for her to speak her mind, offered her sound advice as her friend kept the love I felt seperste. I Respected her vulnerability and never compromised that. She then was so overwhelmed with everything and dropped the biggest blow on me that I’ve ever felt.
She’s been having an affair for a year and a half with some other guy. This crushed me and everything I ever knew. As a friend I was mad. As a lover I’m heart broken. I feel horrible for her kids, for her husband. Now, I feel sick. I feel broken. But this isn’t about me I kept telling myself. But then she said that this guy listened to her, was just like her, understood her, so on so forth. And then I ask, “what was I to you through this time?” That was the hardest thing to hear her say. 
Then she asked me, “ do you love me?” At this point I knew things will never be the same and I said, “yes”. She said “why didn’t you tell me... I felt the same way for a long time...” I said because you’re married with kids and I never knew you were unhappy, besides I’m not that guy to home-wreck. I would never do that. I’m better than that. I wanted to wait until she was settled and on her own two feet. But I’d be there to help at all costs. And she knew that. 
Now I’m left with nothing. I don’t have my friend. I won’t ever have the love that I felt, be real. I’ve lost the relationship with a family that I care about. It will never be the same again... I can’t shake this feeling of complete loneliness. I feel sick. I have no appetite. I can’t feel anything. This level of depression is something I haven’t felt in a long time.

dev_pid_4444,"I lost a friend to suicide : Hey, friends. 
I wanted to share this in hopes that it helps just one person or puts things into perspective. 
Two weeks ago I found out my friend passed away. He took his own life. I worked with him for about a year and a half, he would go out for drinks with us every once in awhile, and him and I would go out by ourselves once a month or so. We weren’t super close, but we were good friends. When he quit, we stopped seeing each other as much. 
Three weeks before he died, I called him up and asked for a huge favor. He lived within a mile of me and I needed his help changing a flat tire and wanted him to show me how. He had plans that night but said they could wait and he’d be over within an hour. When he arrived, I asked how he was doing and he made a sarcastic comment about how everything sucks. I asked if everything was okay and he said “not really, but that’s life!” He helped me change the tire, I gave him a hug and told him we should get drinks soon. Him and I had leaned on each other in the past when we were struggling so I wanted to be there for him. 
I didn’t reach out soon enough. When I heard the news I was in shock. I was with a friend and went into their bathroom and literally fell to my knees and silently sobbed. When I drove home that night I cried. I took a different way home than normal and by coincidence passed the bar that him and I would go to. I had to pull over because I was crying so hard. I was sobbing and screaming “it would’ve been okay, I promise you. Everything would’ve been okay.” As if he could hear me. The next day, I had to leave work because I couldn’t stop crying. I took the day after that off. I couldn’t think about anything besides the fact that he was gone. Whenever I was outside I would think that everything just felt different. The world feels different and empty without him in it. 
You always think about how sad your parents will be, your best friends, your SO. He wasn’t my best friend, we saw each other once every 4 or 5 months. Even ex-coworkers who hadn’t seen him in a year are grieving massively. My coworkers and I arranged a dinner with his family and friends last weekend and I witnessed first hand the grief they were experiencing. 10 of us who worked with him showed up, one drove 5 hours to be there. The others opted out because they were still struggling so much (they will be attending the official memorial). My point is, death reaches so much further than you think it will. 
I’ve been there, and I know that when you’re feeling so low, you truly think the people in your life will be better off without you. I’ve also gotten past that and have made amazing progress in my mental health journey. I also recognize that everyone has different struggles and I’m not trying to downplay anything you might be going through. But experiencing the grief, and seeing the grief that the people closest to him were going through adds even more perspective to it for me. 
Anyways, this was way longer than I expected. Reach out to your friends and tell them you love them and are there for them, if you’re in a place mentally where you are able to do so. And feel free to reach out to me personally if you are struggling.",0

He doesn't know that I'm dealing with depression that makes me want to sleep all day, makes me become easily bored with every want and need, makes me want to be left the fuck alone, and makes my head feels like it's caving in on itself because of the lack of ""happy chemicals"" in it.
He doesn't know that I'm dealing with ""Trans-Guilt,"" that makes me almost unable to look my parents in the eyes anymore because of what my brain tells me I've done, because I've ""killed"" their daughter-- my dad's only daughter-- and that I'm a disappointment because I didn't amount to what they'd planned for me in my life, and how that makes me want to stay away because I'm sick of my presence being used to fill a room, and how I always seem to hurt people.

Move on like I did the others. 
But I just can't for some reason. Focusing on stuff is super difficult and I worry that I won't find anyone else to like, partially because its so hard for me to build meaningful relationships.
What should I do? How do I go about feeling better?  I want to move on and just be friends with her but I just don't get why I feel like I do.  I'm not obsessing over her I'm just really upset and depressed for something small and its really frustrating.",0
dev_pid_4452,"Rebuilding your temple : Suffering from depression and taking on the monumental task of rebuilding yourself is one of the hardest things I’ve experienced. After a recent breakdown, I realized I have been totally neglecting my mental health for the sake of remaining comfortable. Pulling yourself out of the mud is the opposite of comfortable, especially when the mud is all you’ve known for years and years. Each day I try to make better than the last, but today has been hard for me. So I wanted to make this post in hopes of instilling hope in someone else. Seeing a temple, or skyscraper, whatever analogy you like, it inspires awe. But starting the process of construction seems so absolutely daunting. You may see another person’s building going up faster than yours and get discouraged. They may be equipped with better tools. But their building is not your building. Make a beautiful and happy home for YOU, and nobody else, because nobody else will inhabit it. Take each brick and handle it with care. No matter how slow the process seems, your experience compounds on itself, and you will only get better and better at building, and eventually maintaining yourself. I hope your future is filled with progress and prosperity. Whoever you are, wherever you come from, I love you and wish you happiness!",0
dev_pid_4453,"Good Bye my great four-legged friend : This isn't a question or anything like that, I just wanted wanted to write about my situation to maybe feel a bit better. 
A few days ago the family dog died at the age of 15. I'm 25 and we had him since he was 8 weeks old.
When I moved out at 17 I always was full of joy to visit my family and to see him.
When I was younger, like 10 to 14, I felt alone very often. Nearly nobody liked me in school, at home there were always problems (financial situation and some others) and my brother had ADHD, so I couldn't talk to him or my parents because everybody had problems too. 
I never talked about my problems. So there were times when I just wanted to end my life to get rid of the pain and the loneliness.
But one thing always kept me always from ending it.
It was my dog. Everyday when I came home from school he was so happy to see me. Everytime I was unhappy he felt it and wanted to hug with me.
He was never just a dog for me. He was a great friend. He saved me and I wish I could've saved him.
I'm having a depressive episode since a few months and this lost was a very hard one. 
I really hope there's a heaven for dogs, but if not for them, for who else? 
He was a great friend and I will always remember him for the rest of my life. Miss you and Rest in Piece.",0
dev_pid_4454,How do you trust your therapist? : It's always been hard for me to trust and for good reasons too. The problem I have with therapy is that your conversation is not confidential. They say it is but it's not. I can't talk about my suicidal thoughts or self harm otherwise they are forced to release my records and have me hospitalized. The government is allowed to ask for the records of my conversation if they wish too at any time (I know it might sound stupid to some of you but WHAT IF they do ask for it ?! I don't want them to know).  Am I just too fucked up for therapy ?! Am I supposed to carry all my thoughts with me until I die or better yet kill myself?,0

dev_pid_4458,"Some of us will not get better. : Some of us will not get better. Some of us are too scared to kill ourselves will suffer until the day we die unwillingly. Some of us will spend thousands of dollars and hours getting help to ultimately wake up just as depressed as you were 40 years ago. Some of us will fight for 50 years and lose to the noose. Some of us will spend years fighting, finally achieve happiness, and then die suddenly. 
This world is cruel- overwhelmingly so. Ignorance truly is bliss. One cannot be happy when constantly thinking of the negative. However, some live in the suffering and do not have the option to escape it as a thought because it is their reality. Those who maintain a life of happiness are ignorant to their privilege and cannot comprehend this suffering. When dealing with the pain, what are we given? A phone number. It wins grammy's, it solves everything... congrats humans, you did it. You solved depression with a phone number. If they kill themselves, at least we tried!
At least we tried. 
So fortunate are the happy to absolve themselves of responsibility. Yet suicide is seen as the coward's way out. Or selfish. Or 'a shame'. Once you end your life, you are patronized by those surviving as somebody who 'had so much potential' and 'should've gotten help'. Or maybe they wish we 'had talked about our problems'. 
It's us and them. We are made to feel the way we do by them. We want to end our life to solve this problem. They don't accept this solution to our problem. Weak as we are, we accept and search for other solutions. We turn to them for help. They do not want to. They 'help' by murdering those sick in the streets. They 'help' by dragging people out of their homes at gunpoint. They 'help' by arresting people for being sick. They 'help' by giving us a phone number. A FUCKING PHONE NUMBER. 
I've tried to kill myself multiple times.
It didn't work.
I've asked for help.
It didn't work. 
I've gone to the hospitals and therapy.
I took the medicine.
I've spent over half of my life playing the role of guinea pig. I was 11 when I first tried to kill myself. I've never felt trust or love. 
Their solutions do not help me, it only helps them absolve themselves of guilt when I do kill myself. Because they tried. 
And sure, plenty of us will get help, get meds, get friends, and feel stable. Or at least make a positive improvement to manage their symptoms. Plenty of us will make significant improvements and try to help others.

dev_pid_4463,"Life is Messy : (This is a throwaway, as I know some friends know my main account)
I've been diagnosed with depression for almost all my life. Or maybe the anxiety came first. It's hard to tell. I only have a few memories that came before my diagnoses. Everything else is just a blur, as it is for most people.
I was- and still am- always on medication. It would work, at first. I would have some semblance of normality. I would be similar to the others my age. But after a year or two, it would fall apart. The pills would have less and less of an effect. I would switch to a new medicine. The cycle repeated.
Anxiety and depression are almost like Ying and Yang for me. Anxiety makes me over-react. Depression makes me under-react. Having both going at once feels like a virus. It's a program constantly running in the back of my head, sapping processing power and slowing me down. I know it's there. I know what it does. But I don't have the tools to remove it- only lessen the effects.
Sometimes I feel guilty. I have a lot to be grateful for. I live in a safe place, with shelter, food, water, rights, and liberties. I have friends, few as they are, and family. I can do what I want to do, buy what I want to buy, go where I want to go. I can be who I want to be. It just doesn't feel like it.
It's like something went wrong in my code. Like a single, important code was forgotten, and is unable to be fixed. Only the emergency systems run- the rest are in constant shutdown.
I understand the science behind it. Certain chemicals in the brain can be too high or too low. Taking medication can fix that- for a while. What I don't understand is why I can't overcome these issues, when I have full acknowledgement and understanding of what went wrong.
If you have a broken leg, you need to give it time to heal. You keep it wrapped, so it has a chance to heal correctly. Then, you slowly work your way to a normal state.
But what is normal, for someone with depression, or anxiety, or any range of mental illness? What is normal, at its basis? If I have never had the chance to experience life without these problems, how can I work towards the basis of normality?
I feel like something is missing. I'm trying to find a piece to the puzzle, and no matter how hard I search or study or tear through my belongings, I can't find what it is. Some part of me needs to be replaced or switched. I have no idea what.
My mother recently told me that she attempted suicide when she was younger. I can't remember the exacts of it, only that she didn't get caught and it didn't work. Else, I wouldn't be here.
But therein lies a problem that I can't overcome. She knew that she had depression. She got her diagnosis, just as I did, so many years ago. She knew very well that it could be passed down, as it had in other family members. Yet she still chose to give birth to me.
All my life, I've asked many questions beginning with the simple ""why"". Why am I like this? Why won't anything work? Why can't I change?
But now, I truly have to ask: Why did she give birth to me?
She knew the possibility it would pass down. She knew it could cripple someone, mentally. She knew the effects- she experienced them, herself. She still went through with having me.
I love my mother. She's given me more than I could ever imagine. But I can't forgive her for doing this to me. And I don't think anything will change my mind.
Nothing will change my mind, just like nothing will ever change for the better.",0

dev_pid_4466,"I got caught hanging myself : Two days ago I took a hangman’s knot to my school in order to kill myself. Throughout the day people asked about it and I said that I was doing a photography project in order to spread awareness on depression and suicide. Anyway, the classes finally ended and I went into a bathroom stall in order to hand myself. The stall had a window that led to a pathway with a lot of people. A guard saw me and notified IW (Integral Wellness, an emotional support group from my school) 
I eventually gave up on the idea of dying through hanging because it was too painful and managed to reach a wall and untie the knot. I walked to the exit and a guy from IW touched my shoulder and asked if we could go talk somewhere else. I knew what was up, so I decided to play along and go talk where he wanted to. He said that someone saw me hanging myself and notified them so they could have a chat with me. 
I cannot express how enraged and irritated I felt when they started talking about it. I don’t know how to explain it, it’s as if I had just been caught doing something I was not supposed to do. 
They told me that they would have to notify my parents and come pick me up. 
My mom took more that 2 hours to get there and all I heard was “Why would you do this to me?!” “You made us feel upset!”. It seems that they are playing the victims now, what the fuck am I supposed to do now. There was a snitch in the family and now everyone I know knows about what I did.

I tried a few medications, Prozac launched me into psychosis and hospitalised me and Remeron made me angry and otherwise dead behind the eyes.
I had therapy that entire time and eventually with the help of two excellent therapists, worked my life out. I finished school, got a place at university and moved to the city I always dreamed of living in. I met a boy and fell in love and gained some real confidence.
But the city I moved to wasn’t everything I hoped it would be and my relationship isn’t either and my confidence is godawful and practically nonexistent now despite the loving words my boyfriend uses. And I’ve slowly sunk into a depression again despite doing what I could to fight it (I even went on a surf trip to africa, trying to reset my confidence and my self worth and remind myself how beautiful and exciting life can be blah blah - but I was significantly depressed there too). And now I sit here, with a life that from the outside seems pretty fine, but internally I hate myself and want to die.
I’ve found myself thinking about suicide as a sort of back up plan again which is something I used to do.

I've been on a handful of medications since I was thirteen. I'm twenty now. I don't remember whether I took my previous medications consistently or not, but I recall either Zoloft or Prozac making me numb and having to stop the medications. Wellburtrin, the previous medication before the one I'm on currently worked for me, but only for a week and a half. It was great while it lasted, but I ultimately figured it was because it took me a long time to take Wellburtrin consistently, and now that I had, my body had gotten used to it. I've been taking my current medicaton, Lexapro consistently and noticed that I was beginning to feel happier. Then, again, just like Wellburtrin, I noticed my depression beginning to seep through, having moments where I will get depressed, then happy and excited for life, then having a huge mental breakdown and realizing my medication was no longer working for me. 
Lexapro worked for me for.. I want to say a good week and a half, and I've only been on it for two months at this point. I understand if medication stops working after a long time, but the past two medications I've taken and that have worked stopped after a week and a half of happiness. I feel hopeless and like any medication I take won't work for me, and like there's no point in even continuing to try. Is this normal?

dev_pid_4477,"Some psychiatrists are really... weird : Warning: This post deals with social issues and can be potentially triggering.
This happened a few months ago in October, when I had to be hospitalised for suicidal ideation (it was voluntary and only for a couple of days).
The first thing I had to do was talk to the psychiatrist/doctor and explain my situation. I went over the obvious reasons for my depression; being isolated, being left out, no self-esteem. Then he asks me about friends. I explain I have a couple people I consider friends but I rarely talk to them, let alone hang out with them. He wonders why that is. I say I don't like to open up to people and am afraid of being hurt. Then he asks if I have a girlfriend (I'm 19) and I say no. He asks if I've had one in the past, I say no again. *Then*, and this is the weird part, he asks me *why*.
I'm pretty much stunned at this point. Why does that seem odd to him? Am I really that much of a fuck-up? Is it not normal to not have had a girlfriend at the age of 19? I take a moment to process this and just blurt out ""I don't really know?"" He goes on, asking if I'm not interested in relationships. Of course I'm fucking interested. Does he not realise that the other person has to be interested too? Can he really not see that I am not someone people are interested in? I can't just go up to a girl and say ""Hey, you're my girlfriend now. Love you."" Apparently he thinks it's weird that I've never had a girlfriend. Well thanks, don't I feel good about myself. He literally said: ""That's odd."" All I can think to answer is ""Okay?""
Then he tells me I should hang out with people more. That I should go on walks with girl friends. Well, I'd love to, but you see, other people don't want to do that. And who am I supposed to befriend? I don't go to school and am unemployed. I don't have any contact outside my immediate family. I can't just message someone I barely know and start talking. That's honestly creepy.

dev_pid_4479,"Coming up on my one year anniversary : I was committed a year ago because I had a detailed plan. Have had major depressive disorder all my life, but it got progressively worse after I was dragged back to work (in a job I hated) two weeks after major surgery, and 8 weeks before my surgeon wanted me to. That's a pain and a weakness I wouldn't wish on anyone. I was in a wheelchair for two weeks so I could still do my job, but I'd feel my muscles tremble from sitting upright after only 30 minutes.
Husband (who can be the world's biggest jerk, and I refuse to defend him in this instance) declared ""I wish you'd just kill yourself when you say you want to"" during an argument that only he wanted to have (he didn't think I should have lunch so he'd have more time to play cards, where his parents were going to feed him. He really sounds like a major abuser, and he was and can still be). I kicked him out that day, and was going to go to work, then come home and take a hot bath. I figured it was the largest chunk of time before I'd be missed.
Luckily, I had a counselor who knew something was horrifically wrong. After prodding, I spilled it all. She helped me get admitted to the hospital and stayed with me until a family member could come take me. I was scared sick, because my mom always stigmatized being committed because it would ""end your teaching career forever."" Can't have that, can we.
While I was in the hospital, it all stopped, and it was insane for me. I knew I hated teaching, and I hated my job. I hated it all so much. I hated that I was constantly called to put my job and my husband's bank account ahead of my own sense of fulfillment. Visiting hours were great, by the way. My mom and sister knew what my husband had said to me, and no one was their usual warm selves to him. In therapy sessions, I talked out what would happen if I abandoned my teaching career. It occurred to me that I still have the people skills, the problem solving, connections, etc, etc. When my certification expires... I don't have to renew it. The idea of a traditional classroom filled me with so much dread...
I told my family, and the same day I was released, I went to my boss (who I loved, it was my big boss that demanded I return to work. She's loved by no one). I didn't bother with changing anything about my clothes, except to put on certain clothing items they confiscated. And I informed her I'd be quitting at the end of the school year. Period. 
Two months into my unemployment, while we were in Japan (long story, don't ask) I was thinking about what my therapist had once asked me: ""What would you do you if you knew you couldn't fail?"" Well, I had wanted to be a veterinarian when I was a kid up until I was 17...and then my depression told me it would never happen. I was that weird kid who mapped out my entire life, and before the internet had a wealth of information on that. I talked to vets, I read every SINGLE book I could find, it was my thing. I was that kid that people would bring their animals to look at, and I could tell them a rough diagnosis, and what kinds of tests they would need to do at the clinic, so they'd be mentally prepared for the bill. Vet school was out, but I had researched veterinary tech programs while I was a teacher: the problem was that they were all full-time programs during the day. But hey, that was no longer a problem! I burst into tears when I realized that I HAD figured out why I needed to stay: I had shlumped into my teaching career because my depression told me I had to. I applied for the only accredited school in my city while we were docked in Tokyo Bay. (Husband, who didn't know me back when I was Weird Animal Girl, thought this was impulsive and out of nowhere. It wasn't until the next morning, when we called my mom, that he realized it wasn't impulse. Mom said ""oh, thank God, that's what I've been waiting to hear for years."" She told my grandpa and his response was ""It's about damn time!!"" He had to realized that oh, no. This was a huge part of my personality he hadn't noticed)
I started classes three weeks later. Every day, I am JAZZED to get to go to class, and even more excited to do the one thing I've always wanted. For the first time since I went into teaching, way back in 2009, I feel hope. I still struggle with depression, obviously, especially because I've lapsed on therapy (fricking copays)...but I maybe found the thing that will keep me going.
Being admitted really did end my teaching career forever.",0
dev_pid_4480,"Complete apathy? : Uh is this normal? I've been depressed for a long time, probably since I was a young kid, but I've always been pretty emotional. But over the last year I've noticed a change, and it's not for the better. For example last year my girlfriend broke up with me on Valentine's and I didn't feel anything. Not relief, not sadness, nothing. Absolutely nothing. I continued on my day like nothing happened. This goes for everything now, someone says they don't like me? I feel nothing. Someone says shit behind my back? Nothing. Hear sad news? Nothing. I feel like a fucking alien and it scares me. Is this normal? Am I a developing sociopath? What the fuck do I do?",0

dev_pid_4482,"Any advice for not crying in important meeting? : Dear Reddit
34 yr old woman, on my 5th therapist(all for about 2 yea each), depression, extremely low self esteem, anxiety, Effexor 300mg for 2 years. I have no emotional “armour”. If I make a mistake or I recieve harsh words from someone, or if I even think someone doesnt like me I am a fire hose of tears. No friends, no relationships
I work at a factory, and on saturday our team of 3 was reduced to 2 when a young man had to go home because he was ill. That meant I had to take two jobs(nobody could come in). We worked slower and I thought I had everything under control, but turns out I didnt and error report was written by the next shift. That means I have a meeting on wednesday where me and some bosses will go trough why it happened and how it can be avoided in the future.
What I know:
I wont lose my job.
This has happened many times before, I have even written two such error reports myself about the very same thing. 
I miiiight get a warning. I dont think so.
My boss called me a “major resource for the department” on our previous personell meeting.
What I also know:
There may be stern words that we should have worked slower to catch up(which we did)
People will look very serious
It will all feel like its my fault, like I am hopeless.
I will feel my face go red and tears start running
I may or may not succeed at my usual method of pretending I get coffee down the wrong pipe and cough, excuse myself and cry in the bathroom. But when I do, the redness wont go away for like 45 minutes.
My next therapist session is next week, so she cant help. Except she couldnt help anyway, because all she does is ask me the same questions I’ve been answering for 10-15 years. She talks about how she is going to give me “tools” to handle this, but so far there have been no tools. Do you have one?",0
dev_pid_4483,"What else can I do? : I asked for help the moment I felt myself feel depressed and weird. I went to therapy. It’s been 5 months and no improvement has happened. I went to see a psychiatrist 7 months ago. I’ve tried two antidepressants and they’ve made me feel even more depressed. They usually work for a week then the feeling returns with vengeance. I don’t wanna go up my dose if it won’t work. Tapering will be a bitch
I tried socializing but I feel so weird, shallow, hollow, emotional less, dramatic, stupid, beautiful, boring, and pathetic all at once. Im on lamictal and Zoloft but nothing’s changed much. 
I have no friends. I’m a freshman who eats, studies, and travels completely alone. It’s painful seeing others happy when you’re completely miserable. I’m jealous and sad. I wish I felt somewhat stable. I tried changing my diet, exercising, and nothing’s worked. I’m a burden and I wasted money and time. 
I feel exhausted knowing I tried hard to not get worse, only for me to feel worse than I’ve ever had before. I was in bed feeling awful all day today. I don’t see a point in anything. What more can I do when I’ve done every single thing to feel better? I’m lost. I just wanna be at peace.",0
dev_pid_4484,"Getting depressed again? : So I'm 22F and I have taken antidepressants the last time 4 years ago. I've had ups and downs when I got off and with 19 I was having a rough time for two months - started drinking and smoking weed a lot. Kinda managed to get back on track then and haven't been feeling too bad until now. Lately I've been feeling kinda blue and started making mistakes or have to go through stuff multiple times to do it correctly or to be able to remember it. Currently I'm having a week off and have to go back to work on monday. I just don't know I feel like I'm getting worse and want to sleep most of the time and at first I thought it's because I'm used to working a lot, but when I think about having to go back soon I feel like throwing up and at the same time doing nothing also doesn't sit well with me.
I guess I'm kinda scared at the moment because I don't want to feel like I was feeling years ago and I still don't feel comfortable with my own mind and don't trust myself that I'm strong enough to pull through if depression hits me again.",0
dev_pid_4485,"Every day it gets harder to say “no”. : I’m plagued by intrusive thoughts telling me to hurt or kill myself. It’s so exhausting day in and day out having to confront that choice in my head. It could be over something major or minor, but I’ll obsess over past present and future and weigh the likelihood of things getting better vs finally taking the last step. 
It’s day in and day out, and I can’t seem to escape the constant reminder of an easy way to stop the pain. There are reasons I can’t go through with it, but the reasons make it worse. I chose to leave and get medical help, but all that got me was facing homelessness (again) and losing my children.
I am sick, I have therapy, I have antidepressants, but I’m not getting better. The mental anguish is getting worse. I can’t stop obsessing over my children growing up without me, it hurts so much more than I can adequately express. I am constantly screaming internally and I have no outlet.
Yes I have family but they don’t understand. I can’t open up to them. All I get is either annoying optimism or meaningless platitudes. How can I ease the burden on my mind when the gut wrenching depression is all I know? I feel lost and adrift in this bleak ocean and I don’t know how much longer I can keep my head above water.
I’m 30, I have nothing to show for it but a life of regrets. The only things to bring legitimate joy was my kids, and now that they are gone, what left is there for me? I can’t handle losing that connection I had with them, and I feel it slipping.
I just can’t shake the feeling that things will never get better. I’m drowning and there’s nothing around for me to hold on to. It scares me and leads to mental anguish, which feeds back into the self hate and suicidal thoughts. Which scares me and and repeats the process.
It’s easy to say no when you have things worth living for, it’s harder when those things are so far away you’re effectively alone.",0
dev_pid_4486,"I keep daydreaming and having fantasies to pass the time : I didn't realised at first. I think this is a long process with ups and downs. I'm 28 and I think I've been depressed since I'm 10. I've been having fantasies to escape reality. I don't do it on purpose, I can't help it. It's just that it's better than real life, it's ""less boring"". I daydream while I was on high school, or when I was on uni or now at work. Even when I'm by myself at home reading things on the internet, or if I visit family or hang out with friends, things will often get boring and I will escape reality. I imagine how my life would be if I was able to get tons of chics, or if I was rich, or if I had some kind of superpower of ability, or if I lived in a fantastic world, or if could time-travel at will (to correct my mistakes, or to experience several timelines, or to simply get rich by betting like Marty McFly). I'm realising that the fantasies are getting more detailed and sophisticated. My latest one is that I imagine myself having some kind of little calendar book or pocket diary. For observers the book will look ordinary, and they won't see anything weird, but for me, I will see text and pictures appearing on its pages. The book will tell me anything I need to know: ""Don't book that flight, it will crash"", or ""Call sick that day, because it's gonna be a bad day at work"", or ""Don't forget about that thing"", or ""Next time you have a debate about this topic, you can refute them with this argument"", or ""These are the football matches results for next week, and this is how much people are going to bet"". Also for satisfying my curiosity ""What was the population in 100 AD? (like the exact one, not estimates)"", or ""What is the Voynich manuscript about and what does it say?"", or ""Did Jesus really existed, and where and when?"", etc, etc. This will help my anxiety because it would prevent me from taking risks, it'd make  rich of course and it'd satisfy my curiosity. I'll be reading in my book calmly and others would think I'm just checking my calendar.
Anyway, this kind of supernatural things will never happen. I know that. But I keep fantasising anyway,
One of my hopes is that with the progress in virtual reality, I could experience these things to some extent some day. Sometimes I'm optimistic when I see all the progress in technology and how the economy grows (we produce more, salaries are higher, etc). But when I see how shitty politics and society is, I get pessimistic.

I had the pills in my hand, took half of them and ended up throwing them back up before I could get the rest down. I hate living and it’s too painful to keep trying and falling back worse.
I’ve been through intensive therapy, been admitted and sectioned before; none of it has helped, nothing releases my pain or anger; I just end up making it worse.

Now that's all taken away from me.  The only thing left for me to do is go shopping at grocery stores and all that adds is stress these days.  My dog recently died and now I can't enjoy a single thing and my anxiety seems like it's going to make my head explode.  Even my camping plans for most of summer are gone because I can't camp with a tent I need a camper.

I am absolutely disappointed with myself and I don't understand why the fuck I even exist. I am average at best in everything i try to strive for. Life wasn't always good for my family but I never felt like I hit this level before. Since college, I've slowly hit a depressing spiral that has only accelerated and gotten worse over time. Before I even started my first semester, I lost my dad, which just shook my whole world beyond belief and ever since I feel like I just can't win at anything. I'm even fully aware of some accomplishments that I probably should be proud of but I can't even acknowledge them, they just feel undeserved. I'm undeserving. I get so overly attached to people emotionally that when they inevitably leave I can't recover. I constantly deal with this brain fog and loss of motivation to the point that I feel inadequate in every aspect of my life and find no joy from passions. I just have to phone in the emotions I believe I'm supposed to have during any moment. I've fought through suicidal thoughts and then some. Now I'm to the point where any minor inconvenience tips my scales easily and if it gets too bad I cut my arms with scissors. 
Y'all I'm so tired. I don't want to kill myself, I admit suicide scares me so much. But I also don't want to do this anymore.  All the painful memories, the mistakes, all of it is too much.

I lost trust with people irl. 
I now lost trust with people online — whom I had established relationships. 
I don’t know who I am anymore. I act differently than what I thought I should be?
I used to be sociable where I put on a mask of fake smile because it’s socially acceptable. It’s what people expect from me. 
I thought it was never ‘me’ as despite the mask, I’m sad, miserable, depressed and bulimic from the inside. 
I got hit by a bad depression relapse last August and things went sour. I stopped wearing the friendly mask irl and hid myself online. I became distant with people. I only talk with 3-4 persons irl out of tens to hundreds of people that I know in person. And this is in the premise that these 3-4 persons sent me tens of messages and gave me several missed calls before I respond back after days. 
I am very distant that I only have a poker face on from the outside. 
I do started wearing that happy mask online. On reddit. But it never gave me my sense of self. I trusted people who ended up breaking me.

dev_pid_1803,"It sucks being the back-up friend : I have a group of friends I've kept in contact with from high school, and we all just graduated college. Fortunately for me, everyone moved to the major city where I attended college and decided to stay. We've mentioned how fortunate and lucky we are that all four of us stayed in touch, actually liked one another in high school, and up to now in the beginning of our young adult lives, but sometimes I feel like the odd man out. 
Like last night, I saw that the three of them went out, and I didn't get the invite, which was fine. But then this morning, our group text was used to talk about brunch plans and everyone was chiming in, which is great. Except the last text in the group before that was me trying to make brunch plans and nobody answered, which makes me feel like nobody wants to hang out if I'm the one initiating plans. Then, they started talking about things that happened last night, and so when I finally just said ""I'm lost,"" one of them explained the situation to me and said that it was an ""impromptu meetup."" 
I may just be overanalyzing this, but the only ways I see the impromptu meetup happening are if they individually texted each other and just didn't want to invite me or that there's a separate group text where I'm left out. It just really stinks because I genuinely think of these guys as my best friends, and I was so excited to have them here in my city.

My point is that 5 years ago I was majorly in debt with a problem surrounded by people who hates me and I was being crushed under, by keeping myself to myself and allowing myself to heal and working on personal goals things havnt changed much, I've improved as an artist but that's all, no one's perception of me has changed, and that's what makes me realise that it's my attitude towards life that can hurt, I'm alone, I get sad all the time, I still feel depressed hugely, but the difference is I now recognise it as an illness and not self hatred, just a hatred of my perception of the world's perception on me, my point is just grow yourself, take a step everyday towards who you want to be, walk a meter everyday and in less than 3 years you'll have traveled to somewhere to you didn't recognise from where you were stood, I expect no upvotes or downvotes and maybe even some hate but I think it's important to realise the difference between what causes depression and what depression causes. Thanks for listening",1
dev_pid_1807,"The dust and the mess of our mornings : I think about killing myself frequently. 
But not so much the act of doing it, more-so the aftermath. My parents or friends coming into my place after not hearing from me for a few days or weeks, only to find my distended, bloated corpse and malnourished dog waiting to greet them.
I don't get upset when I think of ending it all, I get upset at the idea of the aftermath. My dog, suffering alone until someone arrives. My father coming in to the awful smell, too late to talk me out of it. Too late for anything. 
So, I don't do it. I just languish in this swamp of thoughts and disdain. I find myself hopping on to social media to find reprieve in depressing self-loathing memes. It really is a medicine for the weary soul to know others out there are coping with similar thoughts by making funny pictures to share online. 
I'm grateful for that.
I find myself sitting alone most days after work. I come home, pet my dog and watch my favorite news and TV shows. I curse at the screen when I see the leaders of the country I live in lie and cheat and steal. I clinched my teeth when I see pictures and videos of happier people doing happier things in a happier life and I resent them. 
I see a successful person or attractive woman and my heart fills with self-hatred. Some cancerous lesion that flares up whenever I'm reminded that I'm 38 and still haven't found purpose to my existence. 
For some of us, it comes so easily. For others it doesn't come at all. This self-loathing does its best to assign blame to other things and other situations, but in the end it all comes back to me. I've had plenty of opportunity to change, to grow- to be. But I could never muster the will. Even with the things I'm passionate about, Ive found myself held back by insecurity and anxiety. 
I'm a type 1 diabetic. In 2018 I had a heart attack. I have a defibrillator installed below my left collarbone now and have since gained 30 lbs. This all happened because I gave up. I started drinking 18-30 beers a night after work and chain smoking cigarettes. I would find myself trashed on Facebook at 3am casting insults at whoever read my status updates, lashing out at anyone who even seemed like they lived some decent life. I hate everything, but after my heart attack I felt this awakening. 
What a relief to survive all that it was. I went through Hell recovering from it. I thought that it was something keeping me here because my life was going to finally mean something- but it never did. This epiphany of hope became a pillar of salt and in the present I feel more lost than I did before. I don't drink anymore, nor do I smoke cigarettes. Antidepressants ruined my love life and after attempting to change the type I was taking, had a quite terrifying mental episode that I never want to go through again. 
So, now I'm off of them again. Trying to digest life in small bites. Trying to smile in public places and pretend that my life is full of joy, friends and family. It's taxing to pretend, and its full time. It doesn't stop when I'm alone. I pretend alone, too. I ignore what hurts until I can't any longer. Eventually, the people I've loved and lost start seeping back into memory. ancient memories of friends that have died will pop in without provocation and play back in my head over and over. 
I will think of the activities in store for my day and realize don't have any. So I will sit and be afraid that this is it. The weight of these feelings a constant in a life that has nothing going for it that makes me okay to carry on. 
I sleep for long periods of time in hopes that I will fall into a dream or nightmare. In those places I can still see things I miss and people I love. I saw my grandfather last night and though I can't remember hardly anything of the dream now, I remember talking with him then. 
I don't believe there is some omnipotent being looking out for us. I don't believe that my grandfather's presence (or anyone I've lost) is here to nurture and care for us. I think that death is like birth- it's oblivion until you're living it. 
Some endless, dreamless sleep. 
I'm ready to sleep now so long as it doesn't trap me in some afterlife. I'm tired of writing this right now, but I feel like I may add more to it. If anything, I think this has been therapeutic for me. In hindsight, I am angry at myself for writing it. 
I am angry at myself about everything.",1

I managed to stop hating myself for a few months here and there and the extra confidence only gave me a hope that reality destroyed with its way of never being kind to me. I started working out recently which used to give me those happy feeling from the chem dump in the brain, but for the last week I’ve only felt worse after working out and hate myself even more for being such a deficient human being. I let myself over eat for years and became a sloppy fat ass and I’ll never be able to lose all the skin even after losing the weight and thoughts of just not being here anymore are the brightest sparks in my brain. Every other thought just comes in dimly and brings dread and loathing towards myself and the situations I create.",1
dev_pid_1810,"I have deep hatred for who I am : I am buried by my thoughts. Trapped in my own mind and I cannot escape. Filled with sadness, but not depression. Feeling like I have no purpose but no reason to die. I do not want to die, I want to live, but for what reason? 
It seems that everything I attempt to do, I fail. My lack of foresight triggers my anxiety like no other. I am so lost in my life. I feel like there’s nothing more for me to do. I have already proved to society that I do not benefit anyone. My presence is unnecessary, life goes on. 
I search for happiness with no result. No matter how hard I try, I am always discouraged and feel like that is nothing I can do to better myself. 
I’m very ugly inside and out. There is nothing good about me. Everything I do is for others. I do not care about myself at all. I’d rather make someone else happy than make myself happy. I always put others before me and I feel so unappreciated. I’m inferior, everyone is better than me. 
I feel like I’ve lost contact with my soul. I don’t even know who I am anymore. I’m completely institutionalized. Go to school, come home and do homework and do nothing with myself the rest of the day. Rinse and repeat. 
I’m traumatized by my past. I decided in December 2019 that I should off myself. I overdosed on aspirin and took 100 pills, 32,500 mg. It was past the lethal amount. I assumed I wouldn’t wake up the next day and that night was the end of me. The ringing in my ears became so loud after I took the pills that I couldn’t even think. I thought, this is it. The next morning, I woke up, in incredible pain. I said, maybe tomorrow I won’t wake up. So I endured the pain for the rest of the day. Woke up again, hoping the next morning I won’t wake up. I was wrong, the next morning I woke up in the ICU with extensive kidney damage and hearing loss. I thought, I’m not destined to die yet. I couldn’t believe what I had done to myself and that I needed to change. 
Current day, I am no longer depressed but I am not happy. I am empty. I don’t know what to do with my free time and I cannot dispose of my thoughts. I try to escape from my thoughts with drugs and sex but I still feel so incomplete. I feel like a chunk of me has been missing since I overdosed. I feel like I don’t even have a personality anymore. 
I am very sensitive and the smallest things can make me cry. I have always been like that, I’m vulnerable. I feel like my soul is long gone and I can’t retrieve it. I yearn for happiness but I can never find it. I’m not enough for anyone and I can’t fulfill others needs. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just want to be able to wake up feeling like it’s going to be a good day for once.",1

dev_pid_1813,"Fighting : I don’t know if many of you are aware but the recently crowned boxing heavyweight champion Tyson Fury struggles with depression. He became champion a few years ago and after that he fell into depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, and gained a massive amount of weight. He tells a story of him realizing in a sudden moment of what he wanted and where he actually wanted to be.... well fast forward 3 years later and he is once again a heavyweight champion. This story truly inspired me and recently I decided that I was going to make a major change in my life. I was going to start exercising, waking up early, making my bed, eating right and I will say it has helped immensely. I know depression is something that goes away over night or goes away at all but I think finding things like motivation from others is key. Currently I’m losing weight and waking up happier than I have been in recents years. From 2018 to last month I was absolutely miserable and depressed. Not to forget I was being mentally abused and manipulated by my ex. I didn’t like where I was in life and I’m ready for the next chapter... a chapter where I change and grow closer to those who care for me and especially god. I know some may not be religious but here recently I’ve found that my faith has been growing stronger as well. I will start attending church tomorrow morning for the first time in years and I couldn’t be happier about that. My message is to find that inner you that wants to keep fighting! The inner you that wants to keep pushing and I promise that inner you will come out guns a blazing! Don’t give up!!!",1

I come home crying from school and also I have to stop myself from crying at school and believe me it’s hard.

The arguments are sometimes my fault and sometimes her fault but they usually end with her blocking me and me being miserable until she reaches back out to me a day later. My depression has gotten so bad that I just stopped going to my college classes and did nothing but stay in my room. 3 days ago I was on the phone with the girl and we had a huge argument and that argument mixed with my fear of what my parents would say when they found out I was failing school drove me to the point of saying some suicidal stuff. The girl ended up calling the police and then blocking me on everything. I went to a rehab facility for a bit and I'm on some new medication. My parents were very loving and welcomed me back at my home (I'm 21). I know that I need to cut her out and I mostly have but I'm still leaving strings attached and she's on my mind all the time.

dev_pid_1822,"Overworking to Fight Depression : I'm a blue collar kid. Keeping myself busy keeps me sane. When I feel myself slipping, I throw myself into an overtime schedule.
Wake up a 4 AM, day job until 2:30, personal trainer at 3 or 4 depending on the day, boxing for 2-3 hours, some contract work on the side if I've booked it. In bes by 9:30 and do it all over again. Go 100% every day 100% of the time.
That works well, until it doesn't. Soon the body starts to break down and the emotional dip is compounded by the feeling of overwork. But 99% is not an option and resting is downright blasphemous because then I'd dip again.

I ruined a lot of the friendships- if you would even call it that. I always put myself below them and that's the only thing that kept them around. I took people's advice and stood up for myself. I said what I thought and how they made me feel and I politely asked them to stop. I told them that I didn't want to be hurt anymore. What a mistake.
They didn't like that. That made them angry and leave. Everyone leaves in the end. They blame it on me or say how I'm better off with better friends. Some would tell me it was just a joke and to toughen up, but what's funny about telling someone they ""probably will commit suicide one day"" while laughing?
Maybe it's my fault.
Most hurt me but I didn't mind. It was tedious, name calling and a deadly mixture of words. I didn't mind. I didn't want to mind. But sometimes I wish some of them wouldn't have hurt me so badly. Hit me, tore me to shreds, dragged me by my hair, and become the monster that I feared hid under my bed and behind my bedroom door when I was a kid.

dev_pid_1824,"Depression : It started a few months ago. I’m 24 years old. I was driving home from work feeling perfectly fine and then I felt this weird numb sensation on the left side of my chest. It’s been multiple months and it hasn’t gone away. I also feel lightheaded and just bad all the time. This is the worst I’ve ever felt in my life, and the worst year of my life by far. I’m completely sober now also, I used to vape thc oil a lot. 
I thought it was a lung problem related to vaping this MCT oil I used for the first time. But I’ve been to many doctors and had many tests and they all say they can’t find anything wrong with me and they think it’s mental. I’m considering starting medication even though I’m still not convinced this is 100% mental. I don’t even know what to do anymore. May look for in person support groups. My parents just screamed at me for not going out recently and said I was in “solitary confinement” every weekend. I wish I could go out like I  used to. I never thought anything like this would happen to me. 
I literally feel like I’m living on a different dimension than the last 23 years of my life. But it developed so suddenly, I was perfectly fine one minute, then “depressed” the next minute for no reason. Is that even possible. Has anyone experienced anything like this before? Can it go away on its own? I feel like the trajectory of my life has been completely altered. I feel like this will never go away and am stuck like this for the rest of my life.

I don't want to get into details but I've not been feeling well for months and over the past few weeks my health has rapidly declined. The symptoms are terrifying. I should've gone to the ER at some point but it would've caused massive debt. I have been able to see various specialists and am going to receive blood test results next week to see if I have cancer or an autoimmune disease as that is what all my symptoms and test results so far have been pointing to.

dev_pid_1826,"Feel very apathetic and that everything I do is futile : Hey,
So I don't really know where to begin with this but recently I've been feeling like everything is pointless and I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing. I feel like I'm living to work and most of the time I'm waking up early, working all day, getting home and by the time I've had dinner and done the washing up I'm too tired to be bothered to do anything.
Every time I try to pursue a hobby I quickly lose interest or get bored. I like boxing so sometimes go to an amateur boxing club near me. Even though the coaches are nice guys, the quality of training isn't great. I know I shouldn't expect too much because it's super cheap like £5 for 3 hour and a half sessions a week but I can't afford much else and don't particularly enjoy it or feel I'm making progress. Before I moved in with my girlfriend and her family I used to go to another boxing club. I much preferred it there - I really liked the coaches, the structure of the sessions and there was a good sense of camaraderie; I made a few friends there but it's too far to travel now. Besides, my parents didn't like me going there because I had a few white collar bouts and admittedly I'm not very good at boxing so I won once but got quite badly beaten up twice and ended up needing a brain scan in hospital. It goes back to this feeling of futility because even though I enjoy it what is the point if I'm not very good? At one point I was going 5 or 6 times a week and I still wasn't great.
I also like music (going to gigs and playing guitar), running, weightlifting, football (soccer), reading and paying my Nintendo Switch. But recently none of these have been holding my attention and I've been losing interest really quickly. For example I start learning to play a song on guitar and don't get round to practicing for a few days so forget it and move on to another song. I'll start trying to run 2 or 3 times a week to improve my 5k time then I'll be lazy and not bother for 2 weeks. I've been getting better with the weightlifting but similarly I'll miss a few sessions and feel like I'm back at square one. With football I'm so disinterested I won't even watch my team play or bother catching the highlights. With reading I won't get past the first few chapters of a book, and even with playing my Nintendo Switch I'll start a game and get bored.
I feel like any hobby I pick up is pointless and I'm never going to get anywhere with it because I started too late (I'm 23 now). As well, my girlfriend and I are trying to put aside £500 each a month to save for our own house so that makes it hard to afford to be a part of any clubs or do anything outside of work. 
I've really tried to make an effort to sort myself out by writing lists, setting goals, reminders and etc. but then my whole life feels like a tick-box exercise and as soon as I miss a day I feel like I have to start over from the beginning. It's becoming all too easy to take days off, eat junk food, binge social media, YouTube and porn.
I feel really silly coming out and saying all of this because I'm fit, healthy, I've got a good job, a few good friends, a loving and supportive girlfriend and all of her family are great too but I just can't help feeling that I'm going through the motions everyday. I've mentioned the way I've been feeling briefly to my girlfriend and she's tried to help bless her but I don't want to talk about it too much with her or her family because they've got enough on their plates with some of them having depression / anxiety already.

dev_pid_1827,"i don’t know how to escape my own toxic thoughts : hello! i’m a 19 year old female currently a sophomore in college. 
i’m a bit nervous to write and post about myself on a social media platform but i just don’t know what else i can do. 
one thing i struggle with 24/7 is my low self esteem and the fact that i’m very very self conscious. i have trouble even walking around because there are so many voices in my head that tell me “you probably look so ugly right now”, “that person is wondering how one can be so ugly and is feeling so bad for you”, “your face is so gross yikes”, “go in the bathroom and check your hair right now- you look awful”
i don’t like what i see in the mirror. it makes me feel so dumb because no one is actually calling me ugly and putting me down it’s just .. my own voices in my head and i can’t seem to escape it. 
another thing is i get so lost in my negative thoughts it feels like i’m going down a spiral. i need people around me or else i feel like i’m going insane BECAUSE OF MYSELF. as bad as this sounds i hate myself so much and it really affects my well being and my school work. 
one last thing is in regards to my family. i come from a strict, christian, conservative asian family. we never talk about our feelings and ive never seen my parents cry. my grandpa is really sick and going through chemo right now and my uncle might be going to jail. my parents don’t tell me anything about it and instead i hear about what’s going on in the family from my sister. 
i often tend to “blame” my parents for how i feel and i feel really bad about it because i know they never said anything to hurt me on purpose. or maybe they did i don’t know. 
growing up i got yelled at a lot. i know they just wanted the best for me but getting yelled at for 5-6 hours straight for instance for losing my belongings made me sad. and the next morning the day would just go on as if nothing happened and i was still supposed to be happy and respectful. some things they’ve said had really hurt me. for example they said they could just see me being miserable in the future. and i don’t know ...... i am not really sure who i’m living for and what i am doing. freshmen year of highschool my mom read through my journal and found some depressing things and i told her i wanted to kill myself. the response i got was “oh really?” and we never talked about it ever again. i tried talking to them about how they made me feel recently but i got yelled at for that too. they said being sad and being stuck in the past is very immature of me and i should just move on. 
but i swear my parents are good people. we moved to the US 9 years ago and we started from the bottom. we had a small room just enough for the four of us to lay down on the floor. my parents didn’t even have that much room to put their clothes up in hangers. they worked so hard and just wanted the best for my sister and i so i feel really bad that i say bad things about them. 
that was so much wow sorry. i feel lost and sad have the urges to cut myself a lot. i used to in highschool but i have been trying not to recently. i’m having a hard time keeping up with everything in school. i don’t know what to do. i tried talking to a therapist at school but she told me to “talk to my parents”. sorry i had so many things to say but thank you.",1
dev_pid_1828,"Why does everything have to feel so pointless? : I can sit here on Reddit all damn day and night, and then when I'm bored of whatever little content that slithers onto my home page, I just go to look over to my steam games. Nothing interests me. Nothing. I load up a game and immediately turn it off. 
Then I feel the pain in my back and remember, even if I did enjoy these games and this internet bullshit, it's just going to hasten me to my painful death. Can't even stop eating because it's one of the few things that gives me any pleasure.
I have no desire to do fuck all. I tried gardening, it's just a lot of effort trying to get some green fucking thing to grow. It just fucking sits there, it's pointless. Same with my stupid goddamn Beta Fish, little bastard isn't even entertaining. Still, I do my water changes and shit all correctly. Still isn't enjoyable.
I just have no energy to pursue anything. The future feels forfeit, an eternal starless night. I just constnatly feel like I'm looking into an empty refrigerator, checkign over and over again to find something. 
Even what little can hold my attention just pisses me off now since the back pain is gnawing at the back of my mind until I'm a bitter fuckwad. Why does everything feel pointless? NOTHING I used to enjoy brings me any pain. Nothing I could possibly forsee in the future brings me any happiness. I've got nothing. I've genuinely got nothing except my ability to rant in an echo chamber that will already verify my miserable emotions. I'm hopeless.",1

She said something I now can't remember. Something small but I just broke down. Started crying in front of her for the first time and was ready to tell her everything but once more I decided not to. I told her that I liked a girl who didn't like me back and I was sad because of that. She believed me and never spoke of it again. I haven't told anyone about what I'm feeling and every time I'm ready to I decide that it's better for everyone not to get involved with me. Everyone will characterize me as irritating because I always try to pass as a happy and normal teen. My parents think I'm doing drugs and say I don't seem normal. I don't know what to do anymore.

I see how miserable he is in his face, he said wants to move out on his own, he lives in a nearby country with mine and people usually immigrate in mine from his to work. But he has a super good job that his brother helped him get it so i doubt he would come live here. before he found out he cant have kids he had a girl for 4 years and they would have gotten married. he is so cute and great, what a lucky girl she was. i feel depressed again, im not worth anything, i wish i could see him. i wish i would motivate him. who cares, i hate myself",1

You're never truly alone, especially in this day and age. 
It can often feel like we have nowhere to turn, when in truth we have the entire world at our fingertips, and while that power can sometimes make things worse, its also filled with the people from this community who are willing to help keep us strong.

dev_pid_1835,"Sound of Silence : The wife is out with friends and family today, so I am home with the pup and kitty. Doing some dishes because it is easier to fight the intense urge to sit and do nothing, than it is the amount of anxiety I get from the mess.  
I cannot be in silence. So I am listening to 90’s country instead of the usual current day rock.  
And for about thirty minutes. I was happier than i have been in a year. For thirty glorious, heavenly minutes. I had no anxiety. No depression. No stress. Just belted out some country and laughed as my puppers side eyed my singing. True peace.  
Once the dishes were done. The kitchen cleaned up from dinner two nights ago. And the dishwasher running. Once I returned to the couch. The happiness left. As always it does.  
But for those thirty glorious minutes. I was free.  
Webster’s dictionary describes silence as the forbearance from speech or noise. The absence of sound.  
I strongly disagree. In silence there is so much noise. Such a cacophony of noise.  
“You are trash”.  
 “No one loves you”.  
  “You are a waste of air”.  
The voices go on. I could write until time ends and darkness descends and never have all written down.  
And the worst of it all. It is not the voice of any detractor.  It the voice of a childhood enemy. Not the voice of a best friend long since past.  
No. It is my own voice I hear. When the music stops. The tv turns off. I only ever hear my voice. My daemons. My silence.  
My question, dear redditors. What do you hear when all else ceases to make a peep? What makes you listen to fall asleep to a movie every night for 18 years?  
What is the sound of your silence?",1

For the last few months, I've been going through a constant roller coaster ride of emotions. For a few days or sometimes weeks, i feel good, sometimes even euphoric, but after some time I always fall back into that hole.
 Towards the end of the relationship, some cracks started to form, which i failed to notice. She told me that she didn't love me anymore, we had a little ""pause"" for about a month that kept my hopes up, and after that she put an official end to it. She was dating someone new about a week after that, which was the final nail to my coffin.
The state i'm in scares me. I knew that it would take a while to get over it, but it feels like it is getting worse. It went from me being sad about the end of the relationship to me feeling bad about myself, loosing my self esteem, and the last glimpse of hope about my future. I have no idea where my life is headed. I'm currently in university about half way to my bachelor's degree, but I don't know what to do when I get it.

Because no matter how many cocktails they offer, therapists we see, or promises they make, it won't change the fact that we are alone. Not by choice but because of the way our world functions. How many times have you heard ""I need my space."" ""I wore myself out worrying over you."" ""You just don't want to get better."" ""Did you forget to take your medication?"" Yet we are told that ""You have to love yourself."" ""How can you love anyone else if you don't love yourself?"" ""It gets better."" ""You just have to believe."" ""You're not the only one suffering, others have it worse."" It's comedic at this point. 
&amp;nbsp;  
Who can blame them really? Spending your life with someone who has depression is probably not high up on anyone's list. If you find someone who will stay by your side, you have someone most of us will never have. Someone rarer than gold, an exception, not the rule. Cherish them.        
&amp;nbsp; 
The truth is most of us are tired and there's no where to go. No one to turn to who won't put you into a cage while asking you to be happy about it. There's nothing for us. Some of you will find hobbies that keep your mind off of these facets of our shared situations. Some find solace in helping others as they are rotting away inside. Others just retract into an ever expanding black hole. 
&amp;nbsp;
Regardless of our coping mechanisms or the labels they give them, the effects of this disease remain. It itself remains. It takes you apart piece by piece. It wears down the people around you until they can't take it anymore. It leaves us alone, broken apart, fruitlessly trying to piece some semblance of an existence together.         
Is it any wonder why some people choose to check out? A real conversation needs to be had, because people's attitudes towards this disease are not changing for the better. The way they treat people with this disease is not changing for the better. It's all an assembly line to produce something they find palatable. Something they don't need to develop any self-awareness or perspective for. 
No one actually cares about the words on this screen, the person behind them, or the tears that fall onto the keyboard as they are typed. This entire website essentially functions as a social pressure relief valve. Clearly it's not working if the suicide statistics are any indication.

Flash forward to January of this year and I came down with a major depressive episode. I consulted my doctor and got back on medication again. I was told to seek out counselling and am still seeking options for that. 
Despite suffering with depression I don't really feel depressed. It's not a matter of being down for me. Everything just seems to be a shady grey (no good nor bad). I've never considered harming myself. I've been in dark mindsets before but it's mostly just been a grey world for me lately.

But at the same time, I feel like I owe it to myself to try my hardest to be happy and successful before I do because I know I definitely have not and been a weak person my entire life. It just sounds unfair to myself. Maybe I will really really try with no worry in the world with the mindset, whatever happens, happens. At least I hope I can.",1
dev_pid_1858,"A mask : The purpose of a mask is concealment. No shit right well when is it appropriate to where one? I find it strange that I feel like I have to wear one all the time. A mask isn’t made to be worn all the time it should be taken off in an area of safety or comfort. I get on here because it’s the only place I can take off my mask while still having one on. 
I struggle with self image problems terribly. Consistently comparing myself to other people and always coming up short. I have people around me who are constantly undermining me causing me to want to just stay inside and shut the world out. I want to be happy, I want to be brave, I want to live a life I’m proud of.

dev_pid_1860,"You can’t help me : My depression has been kicking my ass for the past few months and recently it’s been destroying me. I’m having bad episodes. Becoming so sad that I feel physically sick. Blaming myself for everything that isn’t going well...

dev_pid_1861,"I thought I was happy for all of a month, turns out I'm not. : Nothing has changed. I just tried to make myself think they were. In fact things are probably worse than before. I'm progressively getting lazier. To the point where I can't even clean my room, my car, or care to clean myself on a daily basis. It's the same mundane bullshit. Everyday. Nothing works or makes it easier. I try to tell someone about it and they end up just putting me on drugs. Vyvanse. Maybe it'll help my laziness due to ADHD, but it's not gonna end up making me happy. In fact i'll probably just get sadder, because I need to the dependence of a drug to help me. And I'll end up being dependent on it. Yeah it maybe has a better outcome rather if I didn't take it but I don't want to be stuck on some medication all my life.

I have also been hearing whispers I think my friends are talking shit behind  my back, I'm mentally and physically  falling apart",1
dev_pid_1863,"It’s been hard : I don’t quite know exactly what’s going on, I never been diagnosed. Maybe it’s because my mother takes it as a threat when I bring up therapy. Probably because she knows she is guilty and doesn’t want to be reminded. Eighteen years on this planet, and it feels like nothing has changed. The planet is still dying and we are still electing republicans. I have no control over what goes on in the world, the only thing I could control is my conscience. Yet it seems impossible to even do that. One good mental health week and almost instantly hit with the self doubt, insecurities, and the overwhelming idea of being lonely. I don’t want to be this way, I want to be better. I am overly self-aware of how mental health is, the way I react to things, the way I know what makes me feel bad, and if any of you are taking the time to read this you might be asking the question “if you know it’s bad, why do you do it?”  I can’t control it. I become aware of the thoughts but it’s this evil voice in my head making me believe that I am actually all of the negative things I think. When you constantly put yourself down, surround yourself with negative people, and have a toxic mother, you begin to feed into whatever they are saying. I don’t blame my mom, I am slowly forgiving her. I can’t stay  mad at her forever, she has also dealt with an overbearing emotionally abusive mother. But it’s so hard, there is no reciprocation. I am always wrong, she is always right. My feelings should be set aside, while hers are prioritized. This way of thinking has influenced all my past relationships. I attracted people who are hurt and wanted someone to walk all over to feel better. It’s tainted the way I view my self worth. Instead of understanding that my feelings are valid regardless of what anyone says, I come up with millions of reasons why the person making me feel bad is right. I am always the first to apologize even if I was not the one at fault. It’s this endless cycle, that I would do anything to stop. And there is way to stop it, through me. But I just don’t know where to start.",1
dev_pid_1864,"Being an empath and having depression is torture : My therapist told me a few sessions ago that I’m uniquely tuned to other people’s emotions and inner workings— an empath, an ‘overly sensitive person if you will’— and everything clicked. I bought a book and everything it mentioned about how it’s like to be an empath described my life. 
But being an empath and also having depression is like mental torture. When my friends are sad or stressed, I can see it in every little thing they do, and I’ll go out of my way to help (running out to grab their favorite snacks, offering to go out and do something they like, ect). I’ve always been described as a caring and thoughtful and loving friend. I find joy in helping others.
Yet when I’m plummeting into that dark space I end up weeping in bed after hours of being locked away in my room isolating myself and not a soul has checked in on me. I start convincing myself I’m this unloved and unwanted thing. Why can’t they see how much I’m hurting? How different I’ve been acting? Why hasn’t anyone check in on me?
It’s unfair to put those sort of expectations on them, and I know I should communicate better, but some nights I become consumed by these thoughts.
That I will always be there for someone. 
But they’ll never be there for me.
And I’ll never be truly seen.",1

It’s hard to explain why I feel the way I do when on the outside looking in my life is great, but on the inside I’ve never felt more mentally and physically drained than I do now.

dev_pid_1867,"Depressed, alone, might be in the dumbest life situation possible and have been having suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life. (sorry if post is too long) : Hello, new here.
I've tried to keep this as short as i can but it's quite long... i would also normally do a second draft but i don't feel like reading this again so i hope it's ok.
There are two major things in my life that lead me here. To start, I was neglected by my parents. they where never mean, they didn't let me go hungry, they didn't ignore me, in fact i'm still living with them,  they just never pushed me to do anything... ever. When I was 12 they pulled me out of school to move to another state and simply never put me back in school. my dad tried homeschooling me for a month or two but quickly gave up.
Because of this I grew up very shy of other people and never had much luck making friends. I spent my teens mostly in my room playing games, watching movies and not much else. I was very isolated. I can't decide how much blame to level against myself for this. How much should a 15 year old be blamed for not enrolling himself in high school, especially when it doesn't seem to matter to anyone around him?
Similarly they never pushed me to get a job and so i just... never did.I did go to film school (which is a whole, long, sad, depressing story in and of it's self) but nothing came of it. I also spent a few months looking for work but didn't get so much as an email back from anyone. I guess it's not hard to see why when you, an employer, are looking at a 28 year old with no work experience...
About the only good thing that came out of this was meeting my long time boyfriend which leads me to the second major thing. I met him on line when i was 17 and we've been together for about a decade now. long distance relationships are hard, but it's even harder to sustain one for so long. I love him more than anything and love being around him. Every year one of us goes to visit the other for a few months and they have been some of the happiest times in my life. that being said there have been some extremely hard times, not the least of which was when he cheated on me.
he's always bee very sexual so I suppose I should have known what I was getting myself into. We had a semi open relationship. it wasn't my idea and after years of arguing we came to a compromise. blowjobs only. it upset me but seemed almost necessary. we only see each other once a year, we where both young and horny (one of us hornier than the other) and it seemed like a fair compromise to let him explore with other people since he couldn't do it with me.
He started becoming infatuated with one of his friends. he told me over and over again that it was nothing serious. i really believe he thought that because one day he came to me, told me that I was right and said he was backing off and told his friend to do this same. about a year later he cheated on me with him multiple times. he broke our rule which he knew i was already not a fan of.
what you need to understand is, the last two paragraphs take place over years. when ever he would go out with his friends i was always left alone to wonder what he's doing with them. it was constant torture and that's before he cheated on me, and he knew that. it didn't help anything that he was surrounded by people to play around with but I wasn't. I only had him. I'm 28 and have only ever been with four people including him. the other three where out of desperation. A way to back at/keep up with him and the only way to, at least in some part, blow off some of that frustration and anger. because of that, it was always awkward and I only saw one of them more than once. I really started to grow to hate sex.
when he cheated on me it destroyed me. it was the lowest moment in my life. No one to talk to, no real friends, no guidance, nothing. We spent months trying to patch things up. I still loved him and cared about him and didn't want to be without him so... i decided to open the relationship entirely. My only rule was to use a condom (Which he hadn't been). I feel like a door mat... he cheated on me and i rewarded him by not only letting him keep hanging out with the guy (who he says is his best friend) but also let him keep sleeping with him. whenever i was out of contact with him because he was out with his friends my depression and jealousy was crippling. I tore my room apart, was always angry, and was just generally out of control of my own brain.
I even tried to see a shrink during this time who ignored the things i wanted to talk about, didn't seem to care at all about this mess, kept fucking up my billing and forgetting to schedule appointments.
The time of year came when we would see each other and it was decided i would go to him this time. he thought if I met the guy that i wouldn't feel so bad. I spent three months there. it was incredibly awkward with his friends and especially that guy. the trip was very stressful. His so called ""best friend"" was a huge dick and constantly made a problem of himself to the point of even my boyfriend losing it on multiple occasions. After the whole mess my boyfriend said he really doesn't blame me for hating him.
despite that, our relationship got back on track. we where doing really well. this was going to be the first year we spent Christmas together. I went there in the summer, then a few months later he came here for Christmas. in between, he put the open part of our relationship on hold which made me really happy.
but now Christmas is over and he's gone back home and we're not sure when we'll see each other again. we're trying to get married but international marriage is difficult and we're currently at a loss. it's always hard when we separate after months together but this time has been much harder. we don't know when we'll see each other again, both of us are very stressed out trying to bring our lives together while also trying to support ourselves individually and, for me, on top of it is the memory of the place i was in last year and i feel myself sliding back to the anger and jealousy. I know it's only a matter of time before he starts fooling around again and i know he's already trying to open the possibility with more of his friends.
I don't know how to handle this anymore. i'm tired of only having myself to talk to. i'm tired of feeling walked on. i'm tired of feeling like, even if i wanted to, i don't have the life or personality that would let me participate in this openness.
I really do love him and i know he really loves me. When we're together we're inseparable and do EVERYTHING together. but when we're apart it's like i become less important to his life... maybe it's just his defense mechanism for dealing with the distance but when we separate all i want to do is cling to him, he seems to pull away and it's a lot of work to keep things together.
So, my situation is, i'm 28, living with my parents, never had a job, have no life skills and very little social skills. I'm in a long distance relationship with someone i love more than anything but he cheated on me and is now back home with his friends who, any one of them could be the next person. I have no friends and my parents (who neglected me) are really my only family. i'm depressed, angry, scared and above all, I can't even motivate myself to do the things i know i need to do. feel completely useless and broken.
I was laying in bed last night with all of this running through my head (remembering of course that even all this is only a small part of the story. their's definitely more.) and the thought just occurred to me, ""what if i just fucking killed myself."". I'm not there yet and am trying to fight those thoughts but i feel myself being pulled back down into that pit and i'm so scared of winding up there again and what if this time i fall even further? I don't know what to do",1
dev_pid_1868,"I'm so broken : Why does it have to be this way? Nothing saves me. And theres not really anyone that could ever help, dont tell me do therapy I've done it since I was a child, dont tell me meds I've taken so many, they say that depression is an illusion I cant believe that . No one can help me. My mother didnt even want me, and , I feel like I'm supposed to be used. Why are they all so much older than me. Why do they like my body when I'm just a baby. That's all I feel like all i do is cry, everyone knows life's not fair, I cant even stop cutting for more than a week and I let everyone down. That's all I ever do.  I cant even make friends without being weird and useless",1
dev_pid_1869,"It makes me so angry seeing people use their “depression” to get attention on social media : especially being someone who has received absolutely zero support and empathy from the people around me. I don’t even want anyone to feel sorry for me I just want people understand I’m hurting and I’m trying the best I can to get by. Instead my family turns around and talks shit about me, and makes me feel worse than I already am. I’ve been dealing with mental health issues since I was 10 years old, exacerbated by the fact I was abused for much of my childhood. They turned a blind eye to it all.",1
dev_pid_1870,"I feel like I have ruined the chances with the girl of my dreams : Before I start, I want to apologize for rambling and possibly repeating similar statements, I am so terribly depressed and feel I have lost everything.
I, 20M two weeks ago had matched with a girl 18F I will call Madlad. I had given up completely on online dating and was convinced that everyone my age was just looking for a band aid for loneliness and had no chance of finding a loving relationship.
She was like no other. Even though I had low energy with replies she showed so much interest and we really hit it off. She ended up asking if I wanted to facetime in which I agreed.
We started facetiming and it was not awkward at all, we both felt an emotional connection to eachother and proceeded for the next three days to facetime for hours on end while we did homework or were just hanging out in our rooms.
I live in Minneapolis while she goes to school in Wisconsin roughly an hour and a half away. I drove out last friday and she joked saying this was crazy in a joking way, we finally met and she came in for a hug instantly, we helped he friends move dorms which I met everyone before we went up to her dorm and I sat around doing homework with her before the tension became to strong and I asked if she wanted to watch something after we got food.
We ended up cuddling together and just enjoying each others presence, we had deep conversations until she said that she has major trust issues, and although we just met, she feels super connected to me. I reciprocate the same feelings and don't quite understand what she means by trust issues.
She ends up talking really personally about her high school boyfriends and although I know exactly what I would want to say, I can not and just proceed to listen and comfort her. I laugh it off and say ""I accept the challenge!"" that the trust issues latched onto her defend.
I end up leaving the night and I feel like it went really well until I wake up the next morning... I tend to be quite overbearing and I am in no means good in texting but a master at connecting with people in person, she responds to my good morning  text and how I feel super great about her and that I see something with her. She responds hesitantly saying she was so scared when she woke up and feels that she just let me in and was regretting it, she says even though it feels so right and that I am such a nice guy that she just needed time to process.
My responses were minuscule at best, I was no help and just tried to relate and talk about my past with people in an effort to understand what she has been going through. I was at work while this was going on and I was extremely stressed out. The whole time through our texts just felt like she was pushing me away so I decided ""f this, I can't deal with this right now."" I end up leaving work early and drive the hour and a half around 4PM last saturday.
I call her pulled into the college dorm parking lot saying ""Im sorry, I didnt want to facetime or text about all of this and I know we said we would after work but long story short I drove out and im in the parking lot.""
She reads my text and calls me 3 minutes later, the suspense feels like I just ruined everything... she calls and says shes not there, that she is out at dinner with friends and doesnt know when she will get back. I told her Im sorry and that I can leave, she says its up to me when I without hesitation say ""I want to talk to you... I want to see you..."" She pauses and says okay, she texts saying shes sorry and that shes just in shock but is excited to see me.
50 minutes pass and she pulls in and walks to my car since she randomly pulls next to me. we just kind of laugh before I hug her and we quietly walk up to her dorm where we begin talking about everything.
She tells me while trying not to cry that she doesnt want me to deal with her and that she really likes me and feels like she will hurt me. In summary, we let some of our emotions out and end up cuddling again before we see her friends for a bit, she feels closer to me and more open now, I end up leaving and tell her thank you for not flat our rejecting me. I knew it was 50/50 but if what I felt like I knew about her was true, I knew she wouldn't reject seeing and talking to me in person.
As I drove home that night, I get pulled over for going 87 in a 70 by an officer and am hit with a $250 ticket. I get home around 2AM and tell her I miss her and begin to be super overbearing again. I tell her I got a ticket and Im sorry if Im waking her up and that if I ruined her image of me by getting a ticket since this was my first ever run in with the police and I didnt know what to do or say, all I could think about was how she would see me.
She waited up the 2 hours at night for me to get home safe and says I didnt ruin anything and that she really liked seeing me and to have a good sleep. I woke up and proceeded to text her goodmorning and thank you for not pushing me away and kept telling her how she makes me feel. I am a triple scorpio if anyone believes in or knows what that is and I am extremely ambitious and passionate but with that comes impatience and a great need for discipline while she is a virgo.
She relapses back to the hesitation and we text very lightly, just seems like we were friends and that she felt afraid that she was opening up to me and letting me in her life.
the week goes by and she tells me shes sorry I have to deal with her, that she really likes me and sees something with me and is afraid since shes never been treated nice in the past before. I try to hold myself back and just say its okay and that I care about her, we keep telling eachother through the week how much we mean to one another and how crazy it is that we just met.
We facetime on tuesday and she says she just wanted to talk about her feelings and we get really deep into our lives, where we want to be, how we feel about eachother, the whole shabang. We end the call and she tells me that talking to me made her feel a lot better about everything and that she wanted me to come over tomorrow (aka wednesday, few days ago) everything is feeling better and I drive out after my classes to be with her, we just cuddle for a few hours and talk more about what we want and how we see eachother where she asks me if I can be hers, and that if we are officially dating she will feel way better about everything. I just smile and say ofcourse before kissing her and we begin to makeout before we go bowling with her friend group.
All of her friends really like me and we click super well, I feel integrated except with one girl who is overly dramatic with everyone.
I leave and tell her thanks for the great night and that Ill text her when I get home. Luckily no ticket this time and we say goodnight as she still waits up for me when she didnt need to. (was a school night for her) we plan to hangout on the weekend which is where we are now.
I drove over yesterday after work (friday) and we spend the day with eachother. We cuddle and go on a triple date with her friends and their gf/bf's, we laugh how cringey it is but we are so happy together, nothing seems weird and we go back to her dorm that night after hanging out with everybody and I asked if its still okay if I sleep over, she says ofcourse and we get comfy and get to bed.
I begin talking to her and asking her how she stills feels etc. and she talks about how she feels safe and happy with me and that she needs time. we makeout and I go a lot farther than we both thought I would intimately, no sex which is fine since if we ever do make love I never want her to feel like its something to regret. This is where I make the mistake that I need advice with...
Early in the night she talks about love and how she views it. She is very practical and says there is no love at first sight, that she was in love once but from being completely rejected had completely damaged her. That there is only infatuation and love is a two way thing.
I tell her around 1am yesterday (or today however you view it) that I dont just feel infatuated, I didnt say it but she knew, she immediately stopped me and said, ""No, dont say that..."" I get stressed out and she says I didnt ruin anything but she doesnt feel the same way, that I barely know her and that she wants to take it slow. We makeout again etc and fondle eachother blah blah.
I ask her every question I have had building up and let myself go, I give up and feel completely destroyed as how attached I have grown to her. I recognize I fall hard and she knows that and tells me that. She says she sees something long term with me and how she knows her family would love me and wouldnt be trying to make us work if she didnt see a future with me, that she really cares about me but doesnt want to feel any regret and make any mistakes.
we go to bed and she wakes me up about an hour later just kissing me and moving my hand under her shirt etc until I become fully awake and try to go for it, I move my fingers down below where she stops me and says, ""fuck you"" in her beautiful and snarky voice, that she hates me (jokingly) I say why? and she says because I know what Im doing, and that I am making it very difficult to hold back and she needs my help. I stop and we go back to bed for real this time after I say sorry for saying ""the thing"" she says its okay and that it didnt happen.
She wakes up before me and starts kissing me again while Im asleep and does the same thing where we are just enjoying eacothers touch feel that sense of physicality and love. I subconsciously say ""I love you"" which freaks her out.
Keep in mind I do remember saying this but I was half awake and fell asleep almost instantly after saying it, I didnt really know if she heard me or not, it just came out, it is how I feeland have been feeling and been trying so hard not to say. 
She goes blank faced for the next hour until I wake up and see her so distraught, I ask whats wrong, (This is this morning by the way) until she says I am stupid, I didnt mean it, I dont know her and I dont know what love is. I just sit there with my heart aching. I say I was asleep and didnt mean it and that Im sorry. She says its okay and we proceed to cuddle in until 11:40AM on and off making out and teasing eachother knowing we cant do anything because it was too soon. I say Im sorry for ruining any other chance of coming over and she says its okay, and ""You didnt say anything, were okay.""
We go out to lunch with her friends and everything feels find, she doesnt feel like shes rejecting me or weird in any ways, just her normal smiley happy self. We get back and we cuddle again before we both fall asleep for 3 hours, I dreamt about her and was still so destroyed and didnt know how to feel. 
For the longest time even though I am not religious I had felt that I am just some NPC being controlled by god and the devil letting fate control my journey until I met this girl and chose to make my own decisions, that I cant wait around for anything and that this girl is someone I can see myself being with for the rest of my life no matter how early it may be.
we wake up and I get ready to leave since she wants to hang out with her friends alone later since the one over dramatic friend earlier is jealous that she found someone and that everyone but her is dating somebody. I say sorry one more time and I can tell she is hiding how she is feeling, that she will end up rejecting the feelings again no matter how real they may seem to me. We say bye and she says text me when I get home
Now we are here. 8:50PM Saturday 3/7/2020... This is how the convo goes and keep in mind I can tell she is ignoring how she feels and doesnt want to think about anything I tried to tell her
Me: Made it home
Madlad: okay good :)
Me: Hope things are good with your friends
Madlad: not really but hope she will be
Me: yeah... Thanks for the fun weekend madlad, I know I made it go downhill but that is the lowest it could go, everything going forward will be better I promise. You have really been trusting of me, I know you are going really fast which is why its my turn to slow down so its not you doing all of the work, everythings alreadu out and said so the last thing is just time. Have a goodnight madlad, ill stop spamming you and stuff, you really mean a lot to me.
Madlad: thank you knarsan. I had a fun weekend to (heart face emoji)
20 minutes later Madlad: my friend ditched on us.
Me: Im sorry, what are you up to the rest of the night
Madlad: its whatever lol, we are doing shots and watching movies lol
Me: cool (I dont drink by the way, not trying to be judgemental, I just dont really participate in the subculture and can come off as a dick a lot of the time reddit :/ )
Madlad: whats wrong
Me: nothings wrong haha be safe! (Im saying this while typing this thing out and slowly dying inside, I am currently listening to biggie smalls ready to die album and Electric Light Orchestras Out of the Blue album while crying.)
Madlad: Ill be safe (heart emoji)
Me: (the stupid little excited/smile emoji)
Madlad: Im gonna get shitfaced I think
\- I read this but dont really know what to respond so dont
3 min later Madlad: im sorry I drink lol
Me: you dont have any reason to be sorry, im sorry I make you feel like im judging you on that.
Madlad: you dont I just dont want you to think less of me
Me: I dont (Still dying inside)
Me: I just care about you, If I judged you on every little thing I dont think you would want to be with me
Madlad: I care about you too, Ill be safe
I didnt respond to this and thats the end of the story, its now 9:05PM and I am completely lost and dont know how to feel, what to do, how to react, how I should feel, how she wants me to feel etc.
I overthink and I am a love addict by nature, I am not ashamed of it but I am starting to be, I am learning and experiencing something new and really want this all to work but I dont know what to do... I could really use some sort of guide or just something
I do love her, thats why im so hurt, I dont want to push her away but this constant self torment destroys me and makes me want to look over the gorge's of vermont and contemplate whether I am worth it for anyone, if I will ever feel the loving embrace of someone. I know I am probably over reacting but I am struggling to battle with myself and dont know who to tell since I in reality have no friends I would trust.
She has trust issues and I never wanted to tell her I did to since that would push her away, I am compeltely open to sharing myself with her which is why I dont have the same problems as her and im definitely going through the weight of loneliness and depression while she is battling the way of people and what others could do to possibly hurt her again. I just want her to feel cared for, I want her to feel the same thing I crave, the loving embrace of a soulmate...
I am so sorry",1
dev_pid_1871,"I haven't had a moment of joy since I got pregnant 8 years ago : There has been so much pain and difficulty.
I had everything. I had a great job, was pretty, had a life and an amazing wardrobe. Everything is gone.
Grandmother and father die a year apart. Im still grieving.
Met boyfriend, happy year, surprise! you are pregnant at 37!
Get fired from job... get new job that I am unable to do because I am pregnant and everyone thinks I'm deformed. Have to leave job because customers see me and think Im disgusting.
Difficult pregnancy. Water retention, pain, disfigurement, horrible doctor and even worse delivery. Had to have a c-section. Get out of hospital with an infection that tunneled through my insides and devoured me. Doctor doesn't own up to his mistake and I end up with a horrible shaggy scar. The hospital was awful, the heat was at the maximum, I didn't have a shower in my room, my husband couldn't stay with me, I didn't see my baby until 36 hours after she was born. Had allergic reaction to anesthesia and medications.
Bring healthy baby girl home. Don't sleep. Family doesn't visit or even call. Alone all day with baby...bad thoughts begin. Im fully aware that the thoughts are there and not normal and I would never act on it, but they are there and very much alive.
Travel to home country for baby's christening, my uncle dies.
Start having nightmares about someone trying to kidnap baby or even worse...
Im having a panic attack. Boyfriend is sitting in the couch in his underwear and while scratching his balls says ""we should get married"". That's my proposal memory. Lovely! Fucking lovely!
Wedding day: baby brought the stomach bug from daycare. We are sick - like really sick. Everything is coming out from everywhere. Say ""I do"" and leave our own wedding. Left everyone there to have fun and we went to the hotel we had reserved. While my husband slept, I sat in the shower, with my beautiful hair and makeup ruined crying until I just passed out. The 4 people who were staying with us got sick too.
Buy house. Lost job. Start a small resell business. Get a part time because I cant find employment
A year later husband gets downsized, and I have to move my mom to live with us to help us with the baby.
I get a silly retail job because we have no money. Husband spends 6 months at home looking for work. Finds a job that sucks, but Im still in retail.
My mother begins to make me feel inadequate because I am sad. She is embarrassed by me.
Im sad all the time. Cant handle it. Cant get out of bed. Go see Doctor - diagnose: depression and anxiety. Even with meds Im not better.
Find better job. Husband loses job. We have to sell the house that I spent so much time decorating and making it a home. I have to sell the house where my baby grew up. The only home she has known. She misses the house and tells me every night. 
Get new Doctor - get new diagnosis - bipolar 2. Well... this sucks! New meds. Mother still ashamed of me. Reminds me everyday how Im an inadequate mother.
Start seeing therapist. The only person that has actually acknowledged that I have been through a lot and that it sucks that the moments of life that are supposed to be joyful have always been tarnished by something I cant control.
I get better job.
Sell house and move to a small apartment. Have to sell or donate EVERYTHING we own. We need the money and we don't have the space. So many items that I personally refinished and collected through the 4 years we lived in the house. I miss all of them.
Husband is still out of work. Keeps applying, but no interviews.... can't get a job.
Don't know how Im going to pay for anything. Mu husband becomes a vegan. Do you know how expensive it is to be a vegan?!
How will I pay next month's rent? Ask family for help. This is an inconvenience and we cant help you

dev_pid_1899,"Lost in life : I don’t know if I am posting in the correct subreddit for this but I wanted to get it out somewhere. 
About two years ago I was diagnosed with narcolepsy. This diagnosis caused me to be separated from the military. At the time I was ok with it. I felt that it was just a sign to move on to another stage of my life. From there I decided to go back to school. I wanted to finish my degree and get a job using that degree. This would have went well but unforeseen circumstances have caused some major issues with that plan. The school isn’t offering the classes that I need to finish the degree for at least a term for one and two for the other courses. With school being payed by the VA and them also providing a housing allowance this was my source of income, but I can’t get that in on if I’m not going to school. I was fully prepared to cut down on spending while I waited to find a job to tide me over. I am married and my wife has a steady job so at least we have some income, but I have been the only one to cut down on the spending. While trying to get my wife to cut down a little bit on spending, she decided to get an additional job to earn a little extra money. Initially I was very happy with that. The thing is she has been always working and I am struggling to get a job. The bills were fine initially but eventually credit card began having higher and higher balances and the savings began dwindling. My wife has been using her second job not to assist in paying the bills but to sequester away to use as fun money. Again no issue initially. Over time it was notice that more an more time and money was spent towards time with her friends while I ended up stuck at home based on the fact that money was leaving faster than it was coming in. I have asked to be included, but she tells me she doesn’t want my negativity around her friends. This hurt me and made me take a close look at the situation. The past year or so communication has really been almost nonexistent between us about the happenings of our lives. This was ok when I was In The military because I spent a large portion of my time at work. I really wanted to push towards better communication and time together when we could get it without cutting out her friends.  I began working my communication while I was busy with school. I made sure to tell her when I had free time so that we could spend time together. Multiple times that I let her know that I was going to be free on a specific day or that I would make time to spend with her when I knew she was free, she would instead make plans with her friends. Time after time of this happening has just beat me down emotionally. It’s even more noticeable now that I am home all the time job hunting and I still get to see my wife less then her friends see her. The combination of the situations that put me in an idle state and it seeming like she doesn’t want to be around me has put me in a very dark place. I have been seeing a counselor with her over the past couple of months in hopes of rebuilding the communication bridge and trying to get her to see how I feel and me to see how she feels about everything. The thing is that whenever a conversation about such things happens between us she glazes over and it seems like no attention is being payed. This again bashed my self worth. The counselor eventually referred me to a medical professional who diagnosed me with major depression and prescribed me medication. The medication helps for the most part, but I keep getting lack of value impressions from my wife that just puts me right back in my hole. Over the past few months I have thought about suicide many many times. I have never thought about doing it, just about how I could do it. This scares the crap out of me. It takes a lot of thinking about my parents and my sister to get those negative thoughts out of my head. I am at a loss though I love my wife so much, and I think my wife loves me in her own way. The thing is us not being on the same page is destroying me, and in turn our relationship. I know it’s not all my fault and that it’s not all hers, it is a combination of everything. I feel like I have been bending over backwards to promote healing in my life and my relationship with my wife. I don’t feel that I am getting the effort back from my wife. I am at a loss of what to do. I can’t seem to dig myself out of this hole and I can’t seem to get the help from my wife because neither of us know how. My wife not knowing how to help seems to have turned into not wanting to deal with it. 
My life is not where I want it to be right now, and I feel like I am lacking the support to get there by the one I love most.",1

I’m going fucking insane. 
I met a girl in the elevator of my apartment building today. she said she liked my shirt and that she studies screen printing at a nearby art school. I was attracted to her, and I wanted a reason to keep talking, so I just asked if I could commission something and gave her my number. A few minutes later I got a text with her name. I replied and asked to see her work when she had a chance. After that, nothing. We met in the morning. It’s been all day. I’m trying to go to sleep but I’m checking my phone every 5 minutes to see if there’s a text.
I don’t even fucking know this person. I don’t have any reason to believe I’ll like her other than the fact that she’s pretty. I hate that I’m such a fucking moron that I’m acting like this.

I ended my last relationship because i couldnt feel as strongly about her as i wanted. Looking back she was awesome in so many ways, and i realize how dumb i was. I look for stimulation in as many things as i can, im glued to my phone, i love video games, and it drove a wedge between us because i need something to stimulate me or i feel so bored...  i feel like i am not usually sad but just apathetic. Lately ive been in a much more hopeless depression because of the fact that i know i have no control over how much things mean to me and it makes me spiral downward because i want to care about things like others do.

The only skills that I've learned are, how to withdraw and distract myself from everything that could hurt me. I haven't made any memorable positive experiences.

dev_pid_1907,"Im scared that the military was a mistake and im terrified of what happens if i leave : Im 23, i spent most of my adult life jumping from job to job trying to find somthing that i find fulfilling. I joined the navy mid last year and i cant help but feel like a fraud. I dont feel like a military person, i dont believe in the politics of it and my politics dont align with most of my coworkers. Im struggling with learning my trade, which isnt an issue in itself, but i dont fit in with all of my coworkers. 
I come from a military family, part of the reason why i joined was because i knew that it would make my parents, especially my mum, happy and proud. Ive always struggled with earning respect and validation from my parents and this was an easy way to achieve that, but it hasnt given me any sort of fulfillment. 
I know that staying out my 6 year contract is a good financial decision, id be able to set myself and my partner up fairly well in the sort of life we both want. But i hate the fact that every weekend ends with anxiety and despair as i drive back to base to start my work week. 
I cant decide if im struggling with doing the hard thing of staying in a job that i hate simply for the financial benefits, or if im taking the easy way out by pretending to be someone im not to impress my family.

dev_pid_1910,"Tired of being lied to : You know what’s worse than living with depression and ocd, plus anxiety disorder for 5 years and not getting treated. Going through it in college. On top of that a college 3 states away. I have spent 6 months and have not built  any meaningful relationships with anyone. My roomate is always at home cause he lives 20 minutes away and never talks to me. My suite mates are better in the regard that they are at least nice to me and understanding yet I wouldn’t call them friends. They have a whole lot of other people they would rather talk to or turn to if they need anything. It’s like a list and I am at the bottom. They would only do shit with me when they can’t do it with anyone else. Everyone else I met turned out to be a liar and snake and there is really one other person that I know here that is around the same level as my roommates, but again, he really wouldn’t give me the time of day unless everyone else he knows can’t. I tried to make relationships but I have failed. I was rejected from a fraternity by one vote. Yes one fucking vote. I could not get a manager job on the football team because in their words they were full, but I know well enough that it’s not the case and that they just didn’t pick me cause I didn’t have connections. I tried out for the lacrosse club and got cut so there’s that. Any girl I try to do stuff with ends up ghosting me after a week. Yes I am nearly 20 years old and have never went on a date or even had a meaningful relationship with a woman. The only thing going for me is that my grades are good but that doesn’t make me happy as it is what is expected of me. I am supposed to do good in college. All this has lead to the constant brain fog panic attacks and horrible depression. My weekdays consist of going to class, studying, sleeping, and going to the gym three times a week. My weekends involve heavy drinking and drug use. I have developed a Percocet and Xanax addiction and am well on my way to becoming a coke addict too but it’s the only thing that provides me relief in this cruel world.",1

But I still feel the exact same. My wife is worried because I can’t hide it as much as I use to. Any thoughts or help to suppress the feelings. I can’t bring myself to actually do it because of her.

It’s been some time now, and I’m so scared I’ll be depressed again soon. I can feel the mental suggestions to take things too seriously; I didn’t get everything I wanted done today because it was hard to motivate myself. I haven’t been working out.

dev_pid_1913,"need advice : 22F. I don't know if what I am feeling is normal, or if I really should be looking for help. For the past 5 or so years I believe I've been struggling with depression. This past summer was probably the worst it has ever been, but I am currently doing okay. I don't know if I am depressed because I can work/ hang out with friends and I do enjoy some parts of life.  I have a part-time job that I do that pays well enough to cover rent/expenses. I don't love it there, and that is another side issue but I haven't been low enough that I can't get up and go to work when I need to. However I know that there are times when I just can't cope with the struggles of life. I have self-harmed on and off for the past five years, not enough to leave permanent or noticeable damage but it is something I am so ashamed of that I have never told a soul, and I don't think anyone notices. More recently I go through periods of starving myself, or eating a lot less than I should be. I am a normal weight and don't believe its an ED, but it is something that I will do on purpose when I am depressed/ feeling low. Over the summer I lived alone and there was a time where I attempted to OD..I don't know what I was really thinking I just knew I wouldn't have been mad if I didn't wake up in the morning. There are some issues with my family that causes a lot of stress, although this is more recent (aka past two years). I don't really know what I am asking, maybe just for some advice. I get really socially anxious and the idea of asking for help is the last thing I want to do, but I can't live my life like this. I tried betterhelp a while back but I didn't feel as though it help, but I may have gave up too quick.

dev_pid_1914,"This had just started : I've met this one friend of my (he won't see this so Ill call him by his real name) Christian, back in November of 2019. We've been good friends, until he starts talking about this one girl he has been talking to (she won't see this so Ill call her by her real name) sage and I think of the name and it seem familiar but I don't really think about that much and I've seen her before bet he tell me so much about him and her like how they've madeout and how've they had the threesome with a mutual friend named Gabe. Then I went over to his house early in the morning (note they weren't dating, but sage and christian both call sage his main hoe) and she also comes over but he did not tell me she was coming over. I then realized I've known her since third grade she just had blond hair and a gap in her teeth (with at the time I thought was cute) and she still has her speech impediment which I think is cute also. She then remembers me, and I asked christian if they we're dating and he said no, I then asked if he cared if I flirted with her, he said no again. I start to flirt and she flirted back. After some talking we started to talk and he watched us make out which was really weird. Christian, Sage,Christian's sister Karli, and I went to the local park and just messed around because no one was there me and sage were talking and hanging around and I guess christian got mad so he wanted to talk to Karli, so Karli told sage and me to go to the baseball dugout  and when we did we looked around and played tic-tac-toe on the wall and then I picked her up ( mind you I'm 5'8 and she is around 5'3ish) and have her put her legs around my waist and I pinned her against a wall and we made out for a while. Then Karli called us over right before I was going to ask sage out then christian pulled sage aside and asked her out before I could. She said yes too. After walking around some more I went home and cut my self on my right wrist. It felt heart breaking anytime I saw them together but I knew who she was, she didn't care if she was in a relationship or not if you don't give her dick she will find someone to give her dick... Christian had to go home early and Sage had to get something from Dollar General so I went with her. I went home with her and another friend and we went through her camera roll and watched pet cemetery but when the friend left her cat got on my legs when they were crossed and let's say she missed petting the cat on purpose and I pet her pussy on purpose too. A week or two later she calls him later and he breaks up with him and I am not at all the extrovert type so it took a week to even ask her out but she changed the subject by saying I'm going to a fuck buddy's house later. So I felt great after that and we really never talked since and now we're here and I still have suicidal thoughts and want to cut myself daily but Im trying not too but I know one day I wont be able to stop it.
TL;DR My friend tells me about this girl. I hit it off with her her starts to date her she cheats on him with me she calls him a cheater they break up I ask her out she changes the subject and she stops talking to me.",1

I've had a few beers. Which is certainly no help.   Just the mention of me getting in my car and fleeing will get me plenty of criticism.  I live in a rural area and I'm more likely to encounter a deer than another human being for many miles.

dev_pid_1918,"I don't know why I don't do what I want, I don't know who I am : Hello, I will try to simplify this post but it could be long
I am a 19 years old, and currently in college. I don't have much friends so I find it difficult to confide to anyone, and my parents used to be very strict and I usually perform well academically so I prefer not to let them down. So here I am here. I want to change myself for the better and I want to learn to care for myself (what I want long-term not short-term).
When people ask me what I enjoy doing, I say maths. I tried very hard in learning maths since 2 and a half years ago, and the context is that I was preparing for a ""high-level"" math exam. Thinking back to the time, I don't know if I tried so hard because I found maths fun, or because I just wanted to prove that I can achieve something impressive. Another thing is since 11th grade I started to lose friends and I truthfully don't know why I lose friends, but it could be because I am too scared at making conversations. So in 11th and 12th grade I tried instead very hard in learning even more math, doing both the IB higher level and Further level Maths. Of course, during that time I spent my free time not revising and doing math in doing my own stuff such as watching animate, playing games, etc.
However, I always try to take the hardest course in maths, so truthfully a part of me realizes that I do maths not because I like math, but I have some sort of ego and I want to prove to people around me that I am better than them.
Now, I reach the point where I took way too much challenging classes in university, and it is almost finals and I find myself playing Minecraft and failing to control myself. Sometimes people ask me if I want to do something or have something to do, and I say ""I am busy"". Then, I say to myself ""I should probably use that time revising"" but end up playing minecraft (or another game but I believe they are still the same idea). I thought I liked maths, so I am supposed to find it as fun doing maths as playing minecraft, but my subconsciousness just push me to play minecraft rather than do maths, and I play several hours without stop, even if I initially allocate a small amount of time on it. 
So, here is 2 questions I want to solve, and I want to ask if anyone can guide me to solving it:  
1. Why don't I understand myself? How do I know if I really enjoy maths as itself? I am so confused even after 2 years of learning a load of maths.
2. What do I want in life? of course I want to feel happiness, but truthfully the only thing I know I want is recognition and for others to love me, and this I am sure I want. I just know this because my whole heart feels happy when I get recognition. Other than that, I really am not sure what I want long-term. Many times I imagine myself mastering all the math concepts and become some math genius, and people recognize me for my hard work and achievements. Another thing I want to say is I am sure I want to love doing math, but what if I don't love math in reality? It feels like many of my hobbies (piano, chess, math) are actually because I was forced or driven to do them in the past, but I don't even like them in reality, because I'd rather play something like Minecraft...",1

I went on a second date tonight with a guy I met on Hinge that I was really enjoying, and as soon as things starting getting physical my mind flipped out.

I explained I was feeling panicky or whatever I said, and left. I feel so awful. I was actually having fun and up and left on him. I’ve had sex w other people since the assault and haven’t had problems, but some days it just grips me and today was one of them.

If I tell them what happened I know they'll worry and they'll tell me it's okay but I know I'm bothering them I know all I'm doing is wasting their time and energy on my pitiful issues and it kills me inside. I feel guilty at everything I do. I can't stand this guilty sadness that comes basically every day over anything. I love them so much I don't want to make them deal with me but I love them so much I don't want to be away from them. It's so infuriating to not have control over my mind and what I'm thinking of.

I’ve contacted like 7 different places now and no luck. It’s getting super discouraging. 
I also feel like I’ve isolated myself from friends; I still have plenty of friends who I see semi-regularly, but I’m so horrible about opening up to them or just going to them for advice and I feel like I’m drowning in my own head. I keep feeling like I’m too type A to ever be in a relationship with anybody and it’s making me want to self sabotage and be single and friendless for the rest of my life.

We made a plan for what I was going to do for the rest of the day and I've failed to follow through, which exasperates the spiral. 
I can't really talk to my friends, except one. But I don't feel like talking to them anyway. I'm just in bed, watching videos, pretending that I am doing something.

It occurred to me a while ago that I am not really experiencing depression, but this is the only sub I can think of.  I'm self-sabotaging, and if I stopped I wouldn't be feeling this. I would feel okay. But I do this to myself. I want to spiral to bottom. Not really, of course.

I've been crying for 7 days in a row thinking about you. Yes, you. The person looking at this and thinking of taking his/her/their own life. And how your life and pain mirrors mine. The facade you put on just to make it through the day. The hellscape that is your brain telling you you're incapable of being loved. That you have no worth or value to anyone in your life. But I want to let you know, you matter to me. Your struggle, your sadness, I see you and you mean something. Not just to me, and stay with me on this one, but to everyone your light (or darkness) has touched. The world needs you to live. You do serve a greater purpose. Not cause god says so. But because somewhere within you, your light is still going. It may be dimmed, it may be clouded, the fog may be thick. But it's there. You can't die yet. I need you. Knowing you exist let's me know I'm not alone. And, as mortifying as it is, we share pain. And the idea of losing you would hurt me more than I already do.
For me, for us, don't let go. It's not your time.",1
dev_pid_1933,"Hoarding/Cleaning with adhd &amp; depression : Recently tried to put myself on a schedule coordinated w/ my boss where i have off and clean every sunday so my room stays clean, but im still having trouble. It’s definitely helped having the same day every week to clean but it’s still so hard to get myaelf to do it.
I walk in to my room and i see the mess and it just makes me so depressed i dont even want to clean it, and i end up just going and laying face flat on my bed and falling asleep because i cant muster cleaning my room. And on top of that with adhd even if i make myself try i either just distract myself 10273 times or get so bored cleaning that i get depressed as fuck.
I struggle with this more than anything else in my life, please any advice?",1
dev_pid_1934,"I washed my hair tonight : I’ve made a post like this a couple months ago, but I have only showered once since then. I’ve been so down, to the point I  literally don’t  care anymore.  Haven’t talked to my family or few friends I have. At one point, I honestly considered ending it all. I didn’t see a point. My boyfriend went had to deal with something today and in a way, it inspired me. I want to plan ahead. For the future. So I did some research and reached out to a few people. I also worked tonight. I got off work at 11pm and when I got home, I didn’t even think about it, I just brushed out my hair and got in the shower. That’s not like me. But wow. Am I glad I did it. Maybe there is a light at the end of the long, curvy road. ❤️",1
dev_pid_1935,"Help me : I struggled violently with depression. My childhood was riddled trauma. I won't pretend that I suffered more than anybody else. Ive read many books on mental health. I've done so much to change myself over the years. Ive finally gained the courage to live past my burdens and use my pain as courage to step forward. I found purpose. I have decided that I will create a class in all schools focused around mental health. The focus will be to educate students on how to improve their mental health and how to improve their own lives. To anyone who knows even the basics on mental health and emotional intelligence. You should understand how much this knowledge can improve someone's life. How dramatic people can improve their lives if they use this knowledge. I know I can do this. Im absolutely certain that this will work. I just need someone to point me in the right direction. I'm doing some research but I'm no expert. I'd like to reach out to a doctor who is a specialist in this field. Tip help me get together the data and help me organize a pitch for schools to perfect a proper curriculum. I also need to know where to go with this idea. Im in Tom's river nj. I figured going to town hall is a good start but who would I talk to? Is it ok till pitch an idea there? I reached out last week to the principal of a nearby high school. He still hasn't responded. So I'll keep trying. If anyone has any suggestions please don't hesitate, tell me anything you might know. If anyone tries to discourage me, don't bother. I'm more stubborn than anyone you've ever met. And im insane, I have the doctor's note to prove it. I won't stop. I know that this will help save some kids. Even if I only help one. It's worth giving it my absolute all. If anyone knows a better subreddit for me to post this on please let me know. Thank you all for your support",1

I feel as if you cant openly express yourself, not to mention i feel very low when i talk about myself or throw my problems onto others, especially since i know you're here and are suffering as well; It's not fair to you. 
I see all your posts and I become more saddened that you are in such a spot and I have no words that can benefit you that others haven't already said in a hopefully more intelligent and helpful manner.

dev_pid_1944,"I hate myself : I have struggled with my self image all my life. I've always looked at myself in the mirror thinking I was fat, ugly and unworthy. I spent my younger years letting people take advantage of me just to feel good about myself. This was at a time when I look back now that I realised I was beautiful and thin. Now 10 years later I have gained weight and can't stand to look at myself in the mirror. 
I've been in a relationship with the same person for 8 years. He tells me he loves me and that I'm beautiful but no matter the words he tells me I just don't believe him. I can't even motivate myself to fix the things I hate. Interacting with family, old friends, or even just trying to get the will to leave the house to seek help gives me crippling anxiety. This has become worse since I lost my job about a month and a half ago. 
I hide this from everyone around me fearing that they will tell me it's not true when I know it is. Or worse, making me seek help when I know it won't do anything. Some nights I lay there crying only feeling the intense pains in my chest. If I do sleep I have vivid dreams of loved ones telling me they are disgusted by me and hate me.

dev_pid_1945,"Being depressed isn't too bad : I started coping with depression unhealthy when I was 18, turning to hard drugs, spent almost every waking moment of the last few years doing drugs. Before then I dropped out of school at 15, became a severe shut-in, had no motivation or will to do anything at all. The drugs gave me a reason to live, for more drugs, but I still had no motivation or will to do anything outside of drugs unless it'd get me more drugs. I started selling drugs, it started out as selling weed to get by you know? But the real money wasn't in weed, it was in MDMA. Coke. Heroin, fent, LSD. I started dealing hard to the point I was selling heroin to my mom and grandma so I could get high as fuck and forget about it all, seriously scummy shit and that's only the tip of the iceberg of the bad choices I've made the last few years to deal with this state of mind... 
I'm tired of being a scumbag, I've come to understand this feeling (and lack thereof feeling generally) quite well. I think ultimately, being depressed isn't that bad compared to the alternative for some. You may think right now you're the biggest piece of shit due to your mind telling you so but I tell you the biggest pieces of shit? It's the ones who can commit the worst of grime and let it go straight off them, that's how I've spent the last few years, in a megalomaniac and narcissistic stir.

Age 35 and no one has ever been down to weather the storms of my depression and anxiety, even just being non conversational on down days.
I simply am “wrong” to most people.
I grew up in a stable family and that’s all I’ve ever wanted in adult life and it simply won’t happen nor seem likely to happen.
This happens at work too, simply “wrong” about how I see things - depression makes me very critical as nothing feels good or right.
Everyone else seems like they’ll be fine whether or not I’m around. I can’t talk to my therapist now because she’s on maternity leave. Everyone’s doing their happy thing and I’m just seeing holes everywhere.
What else is there to do but die? My adolescent dream was to not be depressed and there have been glimpses of that but doesn’t seem in the cards.

dev_pid_1951,"In my own words... : A smile is noted as a symbol of expression that can sometimes reflect happiness, confidence and positivity. There was this photo I took during my campaign running for city council, I was smiling, it was a time where I could see God in the details of everything that was happening around me. I realized then that my path was not my own, understanding I was solely a vessel operating through the Will of God. There was a greater purpose then even I could see for why I had been placed at this very moment in time. 
What I did not anticipate and underestimated were the struggles I would endure that were also a part of this journey. See, the last 10-months in this position have literally broken me and the internal house I had been building started to come crashing down forcing me into one of the lowest points of my life. My smile was now filled with pain, confusion and a deep feeling of being lost. There are days I would cry out to God for understanding and comfort during these moments of despair. I never knew doing the right thing or lifting up God’s people would be so hard. I’m constantly faced with the realities of my own childhood and what my family had to endure just to survive in a world that had casted us out for the mistakes we made. 
There are days I don’t want to wake up and unfortunately that’s just my truth. As I self-reflect, I am reminded of the statements I’ve uttered to others during times like this, “Everything we’ve endured has prepared us for such a time as this...” or “Hold onto your faith and God will see you through it.” As true as these statements are, it’s something to be said about how these struggles can sometimes embody such a looming darkness you can no longer see even the flickering of light. 
Throughout time God has tested the least of these, as doubt is the greatest conqueror of all for it breathes fear and fear eliminates the possibilities of faith. I am unclear of the path ahead, but every day I am reminded of the strength God has bestowed upon me to continue pushing forward. I realize now that there are things in my life that I will not be able to control, which is why having a “relentless faith” is so important. You must learn to trust God within the entirety of your being and know that there is “immaculate purpose” operating within the moments of your uncertainty.
It’s okay to feel lost, because sometimes we must be lost in order to find our self. How else would we know if we are ready for what God is preparing us for without experiences designed to test our inner self (spirit) and purpose? It’s within the essence of our divinity that God reminds us, no weapon formed against us shall prosper. We were created to experience this world and overcome the demons we may unconsciously keep suppressed deep within ourselves. 
Our struggles become the catalyst to bring forth our true testimony, a powerful story of transmutation and transformation, that becomes an inspirational example for others to realize their ability to overcome that which may seem impossible in their life. I’ve always said that our lives are not our own, even in the most selfish of times, we are mere reflections of the possibilities within each other and we all contribute to elevating the overall consciousness in the world. I am here today as an example that there is nothing I have done that you too cannot do.",1

You told me that I deserve someone better. without knowing that all I want is you. That I'm contented with you. Yes there are girls who are better than you, but I want you to know that I will still choose you. The girl that captivated my heart. The simplest girl, with the most beautiful smile.  
I always imagine the both of us telling our greatest love story to our grandchildren, little I did know that the love story I want to share with will come to an end. I need to move on. I need to be strong because for now, that's the only choice I have.  
I'm sorry for all the pain I've caused, I'm sorry for all my lapses, I'm sorry for all the mistakes I've made. Every night I pray to give you the best of everything because you deserve to be happy. You deserve the happiness that I wasn't able to give.

I don't know if I have depression because I haven't been diagnosed or anything but I just know things are not right internally. I haven't been myself in months and it seems like daily activities are becoming hard for me to do. My favourite part of the day is when I get to sleep, but I'm not physically tired and can often only fall asleep around 3-4AM. On nights where I know I need to sleep, I use benadryl to knock me out because I find my thoughts are making me restless. My mind is exhausting. It's like I'm tired of hearing myself think. I use music to distract myself when I am alone. I have sort of isolated myself socially too. I used to see my friends daily (I am a University student) but now it can go anywhere from 1-3 times every week or two. I spend a lot of time by myself. I don't know why but it seems like I cry at any point - nothing has to be triggering me, tears just form and that's that. I've been unhappy for a few months but never believed it to be serious. I've talked to a few counselors about anxiety which is something I've been dealing with for about 2 years. It has gotten significantly bad over the last few months. I just can't trust my mood anymore. It's very unstable and I find my thoughts spiral into either extremely great where I love myself or extremely low where I want to end my life. I don't want to use suicidal ideology infront of School counselors because I'm aware they'll have to break some kind of confidentiality. I just don't know what I'm looking forward to anymore. The days and weeks just consist of me going to class (if I can muster the energy to and somehow calm my thoughts of going) and coming home. Even when times were bad, I never used to feel like this. I used to be (and still appear to be) a happy go-lucky person who could find any reason to smile. I can be optimistic and caring and sweet to others but lately I cannot find this for myself. From an outside perspective I seem to be having a pretty good life. I have everything I thought I wanted but I've never been more miserable. I don't know how to tell someone else this. I feel like a fraud. I feel like I'm living a lie. I feel like I want to disappear. There are so many words I want to say but I find myself slowly becoming quieter and more reserved. I feel like hiding under a blanket and sleeping. I also feel extremely guilty because my parents have done everything to give me a good life. I have so many blessings in this life and am really trying to stay positive and be grateful for everything God has blessed me with. I just can't get rid of this feeling.

I am 20 years old I have spent almost my entire life alone. I go weeks or months without human contact. I hate everything about myself I can't even hold a conversation for more than a few minutes without making things awkward and just leaving. I have an empty husk of a life, I hate it so much. I can't maintain relationships every friendship I make just falls apart a month or two later. The two times I have tried dating in my life ended in disaster. For some reason everyone keeps going on about how smart I am and that I will have some bright future, but I can't imagine anything but working my life away until I die alone. I don't even feel like I am a real person sometimes I spend so much time alone I have pretend coversations with people I have met a few times. I have watched so many videos and played so many games I just feel numb to them now no entertainment does anything for me. I just lay around in my room, and only leave if I need to. I hate myself so much, I feel like I am in hell sometimes. I am so tired of my own exsistence. I still can't stop thinking about things that happened in middle school. I had so many big plans when I was a kid I wanted to go out and change the world I wanted to make things better for everyone. I don't know why I just have this constant feeling of guilt and self hatred. I self-sabatoge constantly. As I type this I am failing my college classes and have midterms coming up and I havent studied at all. I don't know why I feel like I deserve all this for some reason, I feel like I don't deserve happiness, or love, or social interaction. I feel so disconnected from reality that years feel like months. I have gotten angry over things that didn't happen I feel like I have spent a lifetime alone with my thoughts. I have typed out messages on this a thousand times, and I always delete it about 5 seconds later. I'm terrified of interacting with people but I don't know what to do I need to do something. I don't do this anymore, but I used to beat myself, like I made a switch out of a stick I found once and kept it for months. For every time I made the most minor of social mistakes I would beat myself with it. Then I started hitting myself after I threw away the stick. I don't know what to do I work at a McDonald's, and I am just a broke college student who can't afford health care, or going to a doctor, or therapist, or counselor, and I have had past negative experiences with therapists. I feel like I go back and forth from feeling perfectly fine in my complete isolation, to pacing my room feeling like I am going insane. I don't know what I think I am accomplishing by posting this here, but idk maybe something will change if I do something different. I will probably just not use this account for a few days or a week or two because I am terrified of what people will say to me. I also had to try very hard not to but I have problems not lying almost constantly, I have so little going on in my life anytime I talk to anyone I half to just make everything up to make myself seem like a normal person.",1

I can remember inconsequential facts but I can't tell you what month my birthday is without counting on my fingers. My memories exist in fragments. 
My mother and father separated when I was young. I don't quite remember all the details. All I remember is constant fighting, both physical and verbal. My mum is a micromanager who took over my personal life, talking to my friends to tell them that she didn't think it was appropriate for me to be friends with them. She had meetings with my teachers to make sure I was achieving at the level she wanted. She has a tendency to be illogical, manipulative, headstrong, and unapologetic. I've grown up thinking I am stupid and slow contrary to what many work colleagues have told me. I believe I have undiagnosed ADHD, anxiety and depression.
I've being doing 9-to-5 at a good company for 5 years and now want out, to either work part-time, or freelance. I've been depressed for a long time, and working at this company is making it worse as I no longer have any motivation to learn. I'm not sure whether I'm depressed because I'm working here, or whether my depression makes me not want to work here. When I'm depressed, I can't bring myself to do any work or be a functional member of the team. I can barely turn on a light, or get myself a glass of water. I've lost a lot of friends through absentmindedness and lethargic behavior when this behavior manifests.
 I currently don't have enough skills to freelance. I've thought about quitting my job to learn some side skills as my current job requires overtime and my anxiety is making it hard to be efficient and study after work. My boyfriend doesn't understand what I say when I say when I say I'm sad, and I'm also at a loss to explain how I'm feeling. I cry for no reason during the peak of my depression, and feel much better after.
I feel like I'm going through everyday on auto-pilot.
I'm looking to hear stories of those who have gone on medication. What were you prescribed and how did you feel after treatment? Did the fog lift and were you able to think clearly?",1

dev_pid_1967,"People already mentioned having depression with no apparent reason. What's the best way to bring it up to a therapist? : Might be a stupid question, but it's one of the reasons I'm currently not going to a therapist, besides the questions a therapist might ask me.
Which brings another stupid question: is it possible to ask a therapist to just stick with clinical criterias for depression or would one absolutely need to expand on my personal feelings ?
I mean, if there is no reason for one's depression, one shouldn't really have to speak about his relationship with people or more intimate things. 
One should be able to stick to ""it's been 10 years and I'm dead inside and I break down and cry randomly and frenetically and want to jump down every time I see a train etc... ""
Don't want to sound like a difficult customer, but I don't know the dude and I tend to be defensive unless I absolutely need to make the effort to be more open",1
dev_pid_1968,"Depression is a Burden : I’ve always reacted negatively whenever people bring their problems up. The reason why I had loved online friendships so much was because, just for a moment, I could goof around with someone. That I didn’t have to deal with my life of ambitions-that-aren’t. That I could lean back, shoot the shit about literature, or biology, or cute doggies, or the variability of tea, or clothing preferences, or how dumb I thought caterpillars look. 
As soon as the topic came to depression, I’d scamper away. I’d turn off my empathy, and I’d run.
“It’s a matter of action” I’d say. “Instead of sitting around and whining, take the first steps to slowly repair yourself.” “It’s difficult, it’s hard. Problems can’t just vanish in a second, but one can slowly wind themselves out of it.”
And I still believe it. But while I still believe it, I also maintain this conviction within me: not even I take my own advice.
It’s 3:21 AM. I haven’t touched a research paper in weeks. I haven’t started on a long project that I should be doing. I still don’t have circles of friends, but merely disconnected voices online. There’s a single person online that I’ve spoken too longer than anyone else, that my ass has fallen for. But I can’t confide in him. 
I don’t mean confessions. I mean the fact that I just don’t...want to grow up.
I don’t mean age or looks. But fucking hell, I’m still that entitled child. I don’t want to go to school. I don’t want to pursue hobbies. I don’t want responsibility. I don’t want to do anything. Even reading, the one thing that I’ve been doing obsessively for years, doesn’t seem interesting.
I just want to sleep. Become a dumb kid again. I’m not trying to defend my thoughts; I have no choice but to go on. I admit it: I don’t want to do anything. 
“Just change your mindset” I...I’m trying. That self-encouragement that’s talked about. “Yes, Orange, you can do it! See how fun this is?”
“But Orange, you’re so dang smart. You come from a wealthy family, make perfect grades, have been called attractive multiple times.” I know. I’m a privileged fuck.  I don’t have anything to complain about.
It’s pathetic, isn’t it? I’ve got all the shit in the world, and I still complain. 
Tomorrow, I wonder how I’ll think about this post. I’ll scold myself for writing it. For admitting to something so abhorrent and immature. I’ll probably be over myself, this middle-of-the-might extravaganza. But my loathing, at least, is true right now. I’ve been crying for an hour, starring outside. I shouldn’t feel like this. I have to do the things I don’t like. I need to make friends. I know. I know I know I know.
But I’m rotten, and I want to never deal with anything ever again. I want to just lay here, in this little room, and never do anything again.",1
dev_pid_1969,I been having a lot of serious thoughts : So lately I been having sleepless nights of just me laying in the dark thinking about my death. I came to the realization that I’m worthless. I haven’t had a good night sleep in weeks and it is really affecting how I do in school and sports. I tried all these medications but nothing really works on me anymore. I want to go see a therapist but last time I did nothing helped. I am just in this loop of just thinking of these memories of my past of how shitty of a person I am. Than I think of the solution of why I was a shitty person and it just comes down to me just die. I truly just want to be happy again but I have nice positive thoughts about myself and think that I will have a future after I turn 18.

dev_pid_1970,"Not over my EX boyfriend from 2 years ago.... : When I was a senior in high school, there was this amazing guy I fell in love with. He was sweet, and kind, he always put me first, but me being the idiot I was, I cried all the time in this relationship. He always told me I was too clingy for wanting to hang out on weekends when we already saw each-other everyday at school.
He would lie behind my back about who he was hanging out with, so we “didn’t have to” hang out. 
And before he dumped me (about a hour before) he cheated on me with a friend of mine. 
I’m over him as a person. But I’m still hurting 2 years later. I don’t know how to explain it, I’ve been in relationships since then of course, but they never fulfill me. I’m not happy. I feel empty and scared that I’ll be hurt again and I push them away before I can get attached or them getting to attached.

A life that sucks this much isn't a life that I find worth living, but I don't want to destroy my chances to help other people, no matter how much it sucks.

Does anyone have any advice on taking it and whether it could have long term affects that are detrimental.

dev_pid_1980,"Existential crisis at 36 : It all started in August 2019. I was feeling overworked and stressed in my job and had feelings of pressure that I was not achieving high enough so I applied for a new job within the company and although I had internal doubts that I would be able to keep up with the workload and amount of responsibility, I managed to ace the interview and was successful. 
Only a month into the role I was not sleeping and contracted a severe double ear infection and was still going into work where I was unable to hear people asking me questions and was in constant pain. I was prescribed antibiotics, but they did not work so I was referred to a specialist who provided me with drops and I was signed off work. The drops cleared the infection but I was still having issues with my hearing, after seeing the specialist the second time I was told that both of my eardrums had chronic perforations and that unless I had surgery I would not be able to hear properly again and there was a 25% chance that even with surgery I would not regain the hearing I had lost. 
When I exited the hospital, I broke down in the street, I was sobbing into my sleeve as I walked, and I was at a total loss of what to do. I had been having negative thoughts for a long while, but I had been able to lift myself from them but now they seemed to be hitting me hard and I began to feel that life just was not worth living.
I went home and kept having suicidal thoughts, I kept thinking of ways to end my life without affecting my husband financially, ways in which my death would look accidental in nature. I was home alone for weeks thinking about ways to end my life and I was hiding it from my husband. I did not want to hurt him, for him to see me as a burden in his life or for him to think I was weak and a failure. I kept receiving emails about my situation from work and weeks turned to months and I began to dread having to go to the doctor to ask for a sicknote (which he was more than happy to provide). I lost all purpose and felt like there was nothing in life that I wanted to do. I would make comments about how the anaesthetic from the surgery for my ears might go wrong and then I would not have to think about any of this.
It all came to a head when I was due to return to work and I asked my husband if he could see himself continuing with the same job and he said yes and I looked him in the eyes and simply said I can’t do it anymore. Unfortunately, the timing of this was very poor as we were due to have guests around and he could see that I was in severe distress, but it was too late to cancel. I managed to hold back and after the guests left, we spent the whole night talking, much of which was me sobbing hard about how I did not want to continue to be alive. My whole body hurt; I had been trembling which meant my muscles were sore. My eyes were raw from the tears and from rubbing them. My throat hurt from the gasps of anguish and crying as I explained my issues.
My husband took me to see my GP the next morning and I found it difficult to start the conversation. My husband began and as he told the GP he burst into tears and it broke me again. I don’t think I have ever seen my husband cry. It hurt me to the core to see him so upset. The GP was shocked and immediately prescribed me with antidepressants and information for counselling and support.
Since then my mood has been up and down, I try to think about the future but its very hard to be positive or think of things I want to do or achieve. I hate being off work as it makes me feel like a burden, even though I was receiving sick pay and my company is supportive I just wanted to get it over with and continue with my life but the only issue I kept coming up against was doing what? I have no idea.
The feelings of being a burden kept growing stronger, especially as I knew the sick pay would be reduced to half and then I would be financially dependant on my husband which I feel to be unfair and has never happened in the 13 years we have been together. I have worked hard to try and find something I love enough to consider the possibility of doing as a career, but it is a real struggle. I also wanted to try coming off the medication in order to be less drowsy the following day so I could get more things done so I stopped taking it (for two weeks). I decided that as I love animals, I would try home boarding as an option and in order to relive myself of the pressure to return to my old job I handed in my resignation. My employer was very reluctant to accept the resignation but I honestly did not see me ever being able to return to that role and if I did I am sure that the feelings would build up again and I would end up in the same position. 
My first experience of home boarding was awful, within an hour of receiving the dog I felt pressured, stressed and anxious so much so that I ended up in tears and back on my medication, I was constantly berating myself. The owner stated the dog was house trained and friendly to other dogs (I have two dogs myself) but this was not true, and I was having to juggle a very energetic animal with my own pets. My husband kept offering to help but as he had been working all week, I kept telling him no, that this was my responsibility as he had already done his working week. But I couldn’t cope. The dog managed to run upstairs and peed on the spare bed which again caused me to get upset. The dog was uncontrollable, unresponsive to commands and not house trained; the idea to be a home boarder now felt horrible and I recalled handing in my notice and asking myself “what have I done?” The dog also had separation anxiety and I did not want this to affect both me and my husband so I slept in a separate bed with the dog in the room, shushing it every 30 minutes and hoping it did not rip up the carpet, skirting, door or anything else. Needless to say, I did not sleep well that night. 
The next day I asked my employer if it would be possible to rescind my  resignation and assign me to a part time position, on a lower grade with lesser responsibilities but as I have offered my resignation it is up to them if they accept this. I know my husband will support me to find a new job, so this is not an issue for me, but I still feel reckless for just leaving to try something new without having tried it first. I guess it is a lesson learnt.
In all this time I have been on group therapy sessions, received counselling and have used the support service ‘shout!’ and have been more open about my feelings with my husband when I am having a particularly bad day. I realised how much I love to write, and I am now considering looking at this as a possible career in the future. I am going to take one day at a time and explore the opportunities I have available to me and I will go back to work even if it is part time whilst I decide what I really want to do.
I can’t say that I am cured but I do feel that I have made some progress. Without talking to my husband as scary as it was or going to my GP to seek support, I don’t think I would be here today. I urge anyone who has felt like I have, to seek help. It is scary, but it is worth it; you are not alone in this and there is always someone to talk to.",1
dev_pid_1981,"I always get the be more physically active advice... : All the advice i get to help with my depression seems to be about physical activity and that is fine, but it's not exactly helpful all the time.

dev_pid_1983,"A technique that will change your life. : The greatest thing you can do for yourself is to start loving yourself because you are the greatest thing  to exist. This is your reality. You are living person with thoughts and personalities of your own. Its the only thing you truly have if everything was gone so why would you hate yourself. Why would add negativity and hurt the one thing that you will always have. Its you. 
Now this technique is based off the law of attraction. Positive thoughts attract positive. Negative thoughts attracts negativity. If you want to change your life, you gotta start thinking positive no matter how hard it is for you it has to be at your core. Even if you don't believe in the law of attraction what sounds better being negative, thinking about horrible things or thinking positive feeling good no matter what situation you are in. 
The technique: Play your favorite music or pick a song that makes you happy, uplifting, calm doesn't matter pick music that makes you feel happy, tranquil, etc. Me personally, I play traditional Chinese music, Japanese piano music, heck sometime I even type happy music on youtube. What matters the most is it makes you feel good.
Play your music and just let go. Start imagining and believing everything that you want in life you have it already. The feeling of being complete and loving yourself. Some things I think about: Im sexiest mothefucker out there, I have a perfect life, im in perfect health, im the greatest of all time. Im blessed. You should be feeling this loving energy near your heart. It feels good kinda blissful. Just let go and feel that you have everything. You are not thinking about anything negative. Its basically metta meditation. The longer your session the better it is for you. Soon you will start seeing changes with your life. Everything starts with you.
This technique will make you a more positive person and you will start feeling happy for no reason. You will start spreading love instead of taking it because once you truly love yourself. You become a beacon. A beacon of love and people will be attracted to it. Good things will start happening.
Even if this sounds crazy, would you rather do nothing and willow in despair or give this weird thing a shot.",1
dev_pid_1984,"Am I just sad? : So my initial post was to tell my story, how I recently lost my faith, unemployed, single (let down every time) and whatever else I could drag in to paint the picture.
I never understood depression growing up but didn't hear much about it also. I even had a friend at 8 tell me she was depressed, I still think she was just sad but how would I know, I didn't live in her brain. 
It makes me so sad to know there are people out there who feel like this because I know how consuming a feeling can be. I feel sadness often and I tried to always chalk it up to something else because how could I be depressed? I was always trying my hardest to laugh and have a good time.
So whilst I know sadness and depression are not the same, I have tried to sit on the fence of sadness so as not to crawl into a whole new scary world (depression.) I feel really empty and have for a while, not being around often skims my mind because the pain isn't worth feeling again. I don't know how I've even made it this far.  I don't want to return calls at the moment and may lose people in the process but hey, it's a risk my brain is willing to take.
I smoke weed and have a drink when I can. My mum kind of notices the drinking but I don't think she realises that I have purchased alcohol before, consumed it in my room and waited to throw it out so there was no evidence. That's not normal right. The weed and alcohol doesn't even numb the pain. I wouldn't move onto anything stronger but it's interesting to see what others have said about these things no longer working after a certain time. It's like the pain is determined to win.
I know I'm venting and waffling. I don't really know if I'm depressed, probably need to be diagnosed, I don't know the rules. All I do know is I fear that the strength I once had is dwindling and I'm scared of life because my ability to cope is no longer there. Wouldn't even know where to start right now so here I am...",1

I had a moment where I tried to explain to them both, and warn them, that I'm very emotionally unstable and that little things can set me off right now. I'm trying to push through this and wait for my appointments with a psychiatrist and therapist I have soon, but it's so hard just to act normal and smile and I feel like they dont really care about my feelings. Even today, I was driving them to the movies to meet the rest of our family and they kept giving me shit over little things like my parking job or waiting to long on a yield turn, to the point I feel like shit and want to cry, but they just keep laughing and screwing around.
I just wish that they would he more kind about everything, it's hard enough just trying to act human and get better without having their attitude and stubbornness on top of it. I just feel like no one understands how I feel and it's almost suffocating how much I want just one person to get it.",1
dev_pid_1987,"Had a shitty, anxiety filled day and boyfriend ended it even worse : All day, I had an overwhelming feeling like I was about to die. Not from illness or pain, I just have really bad irrational fears from time to time, and this time I thought I would just stop breathing at some point. It gets especially bad if I forget to take my antidepressants regularly (I hate the pills so much), which of course I didn't this past week. That one's on me.
But a few hours ago, my boyfriend tried to call me and talk me down from freaking out. We talked about nothing in particular for a bit til it came to a conversation about what he did yesterday night.
He's been hanging out with two female coworkers a lot recently. They go out to eat and shop (which he usually hates), which is a little weird to me, but I was fine. But a few hours ago, he was telling me some things that didn't add up. He said he found out he was allergic to alcohol, but he's underage. I asked him about it and he said he tried a couple shots.
Where did you get alcohol from?
He said he stopped by to say hi to his manager on his way home and she offered him alcohol. 
Wait, but weren't you driving your two female coworkers home that night too?
Yes, they were there and they drank and got wasted haha.
But you drank, and you were the driver. And you told me you got home at 1. Did you drive drunk?
A pause.
I may have lied.
He told me that he actually went to his manager's house party. With his co-workers that he spends a lot of time with. He drank and hung out there until 3 in the morning. He says he drove the two girls home, went to his own house, and drove back to take one of them to work in the morning.
I might be too sensitive, but I had a horrible day overall and this stressed me out more. Why are you taking out two girls to do the things you do with me and more? If that was really all that happened, why lie about it to begin with? You're so eager to tell me about all the other dumb shit you do. It's 4:30am and I can't sleep.

dev_pid_1988,"I don’t know if I’m depressed or what : I don’t want to call myself depressed because there’s people out there who have depression and I don’t want to be someone who says they have depression even if they don’t.
I’ve done research online and shit and I can’t find anything with a solid answer. Some places say I am depressed and some places say that I’m not depressed. 
3 months ago, my girlfriend broke up with me and is currently getting back with her ex, and every day I think of her. I’m jealous and upset all the time and would do anything to get her back. Whilst we were dating, she used to occasionally speak to her ex online, I didn’t mind because I trusted her, I had no problem with her casually speaking to other men.
But the problem was that the day she broke up with me, she was speaking to him online. So whilst I’m there crying my eyes out, she’s speaking to him and I don’t know how I feel. It’s like she never wanted to be with me in the first place. Things were going so well between us, we hardly argued and we didn’t have an argument 6 or so months prior to us breaking up.
I don’t feel happy anymore, like it used to be the case where I was always happy and I would have the occasional bad day but it’s the opposite now, like I’m always having a bad day and there’s only a few moments when I’m happy - it fucking sucks. 
I’ve never been depressed before. I used to self harm a bit maybe like 5-6 years ago but I stopped for a while, but I never felt depressed and I had no reason to self harm, but I’m just getting all these feelings all at once, and I’m not sure if I can say for sure if I’m depressed or not, but I haven’t been happy for a whole day in 3 months, and I feel like my girlfriend never loved me because of the situation with her ex. I feel betrayed and alone and the only thing that makes me happy is hanging out with my friends which I can’t do because they don’t want to hang out half the time. I’m failing one of my courses in college because of my social anxiety and I won’t be able to pass so I have to speak to someone about that. 
Someone help me please. I don’t know if I’m depressed or if it’s too early to come to a conclusion, I just want to understand myself and I want to know why I’m feeling all these things.",1

dev_pid_1995,"To make you more happy : A lot of people these days do not feel happy. So I decided to help the people that are not feeling happy. (Not being happy can have many causes therefore I can not guarantee that the method that I am going to explain will help for everyone.)
First of all I want to say that I do not recommend you to suppress your emotions. Feeling emotions can be helpful in many ways. It can for example tell you that you do not like certain things or that certain things need to be changed. But as a child probably almost everyone told you ¨I want you to be happy¨. Therefore you started to feel bad if you did not feel happy. So you feel even more bad than you did before. But like I just said, your emotions can be helpful in many ways. So you do not have to feel bad about it if you are not happy.
In today's society most people are raised in a way that they start thinking constantly. And if you observe these thinking patterns you start to see that most people are just repeating their thoughts over and over again. And at a point they even start thinking about their own created thoughts that they are repeating over and over again. Therefore they have nothing to think about except thoughts. And then there comes a point that they are just living in their head. And because of that they are not seeing the beauty of life anymore. People can go to work everyday and if you ask them for example ¨Did you see the appletree at the side of the road when you was on your way to work?¨ They will probably say ´´No I didn't see it´´. So they are just caught up in their thoughts not experiencing life anymore. So try to still your mind, by for example meditation (If you want mediation techniques, feel free to ask, you can even send me a dm @quintenvanommen.) Once your are not caught up in your thoughts anymore you can start experiencing life again. On your way to work you can see the appletree, you can see the apples, you can see the apples falling. And if you eat you are just eating. Your are experiencing the apple or whatever you are eating. And than if you drink afterwards a cup of tea for example. Just drink the cup of tea and taste the tea. Once you are doing this you will experience life again, and you will probably become more happy.
Have a nice day
Yours sincerely, Quinten van Ommen",1
dev_pid_1996,"I've started realising that the more you're depressed, the less you care about stuff around you : I've been skipping days at work, arriving late, doing things i usually wouldn't and basically avoiding to do work because I'm just so done with everything, same with university, i skip class all the time and i haven't done a single homework, heck i haven't even studied for exams. I don't hang out with people and I'm basically alone all the time, it's this vicious cycle that honestly feels like it's going to be the end of me soon. I'll get fired and kicked out of uni, i won't have any friends, i barely care to even try and I'm just hoping my life is taken away somehow.
really dumb rant and i apologise for it, but this has been my situation lately and i had to let it out",1
dev_pid_1997,"I got shamed by a psychiatrist for getting depression after being bullied for almost 5 years : He was like “people don’t usually get depression from that” and “you’re not like your peers, you need to chill” , “most of your peers do weed”. He then proceeded to call my parents and tell me everything because he said it looked suspicious. On top of that he charged so much money that I could spend in shopping 😂",1
dev_pid_1998,"i don't know what to do with myself or my feelings at this point : i feel so fucking alone and helpless to do anything about it. i broke up with my girlfriend a year ago. we were together for about a year. prior to her, I never had any kind of relationship or romantic experience with anyone. And, in the year since we split up, I feel like I've gone in the opposite direction. I'm almost 25. I finished college and grad school. I work full time and study for actuarial exams and go to the gym. besides that I do nothing. i have no active social circle where I'll ever meet anyone. my co-workers are pleasant but I do not talk to them about anything besides work - and I don't want to. there's just nothing. I live in a big city, in a high-rise apartment building downtown. i'm surrounded by people and I feel so fucking isolated and atomized.
when i tell my therapist stuff like this, she says ""it sounds like you want conection"". and I haven't had the guts to say that's not it. bc the truth is I don't really like having or spending time with platonic friends. even my friends who I liked most, who I respect and admire the fuck out of as people - I don't miss spending time with them. I'm just not someone who needs that.
the only thing I want - in the world - is a girlfriend I like. yesterday I met some girl just in passing. she initiated conversation - I would never just bother a stranger in public because they're hot. it was in the elevator of my apartment. I made up an excuse to ask to talk with her more at a later time, gave her my phone number, and we parted ways. She could have easily not texted me. but she did. I gave a basic, innocuous reply, and she's said nothing since.
and I want to be clear - she doesn't matter. not her, specifically, anyway. she's just some pretty girl I don't know. but the \~1 hour I had yesterday where I felt some kind of hope that I might actually get the thing I want was insane. I forgot what it was like to feel like a human being who didn't actively want to die. now the sense of hopelessness is so much stronger. in the space of a year, that was the \*one\* time I met someone who I was interested in and felt I could possibly end up dating. And it was either doomed from the start, or I fucked it up somewhere along the way. either possibility is equally devastating.
and i don't know what to do with these feelings right now. i couldn't fall asleep for hours last night, thinking about this. then I woke up after \~4 hours and couldn't go back to sleep. all i can do now is stare at my computer, do nothing, and be on the verge of crying. i have shit i need to do. I need to study. I promised my family I'd come see them for my birthday today. i can't do it.",1

I'm 19m and have been feeling this way for a long time. The immense guilt that I feel has been ripping and tearing at me. It's been this constant voice in my head that is a painful reminder of who I am, and the suicidal thoughts just feel like a premonition into what's to come. All of my failures seem to pile on to each other, mesh together, and the stick to my heart, draining me of any will to live I have left. 
My failure to date my crush without being an anxious moron, my failure to keep my cool sometimes, my faliure to live the childhood I was told was good to have. All of these and more get to me. I just feel like ending it all is the way to tell the world ""I am going to pay for my sins with my blood"". 
I feel like if I DONT kill myself, then I'll just be lying when I say I'm sorry. I'll say I'll never do it again, but if I'm not here, I wont have the ABILITY to do it again, or do anything else to anyone ever again. 
Not only all of this, but recently that old crush of mine just got a boyfriend, so I've been taking that extremely hard. I just feel like I'll never be able to love anyone else. I just feel like that relationship will be eternal, and I'll be left here to rot. Its what she deserves, and this is what I deserve. She's a major cause of my pain, but its all self induced. I caused the reason we're not together, I'm her first experience with any guy (even if that experience was 1 date long). Everyone who I have told my story to, including her, from my friends to my therapist have told me that she doesn't want me dead, and I'm blowing this out of proportion in my head. Its something that I have an extremely hard time internalizing and accepting, because I feel that its just a front to cover up how they truly feel.
I noticed that hurting myself alleviates some of the pain. Its like as the sharp edges of whatever I'm holding take the hurting feeling from the mark into this vault, that will build up over time until I have enough pain credits to finally be able to be forgiven. 
Suicide, in this case, would be the capstone. The trump card. The bailout of all bailouts. Finally, I would be free. Finally, my debt would be paid. I feel it coming. When? I'm not sure.
I can't eat. I can't sleep. I can't think. I can't socialize. I can't love. I can't laugh. I can't cry.

I am fine with the breakup; I knew it wasn't heading anywhere and secretly wished it ended because we wouldn't have sustained it in the long run. What hurts is losing a friend, somebody who was always there for you, knew you onside and out, loved and cared for you and I always reciprocated that love and affection two fold. She was someone who knew what was on my mind before I even said anything, the kind who understood your silence, you can say she was THE ONE. The girl every guy dreams of having as a partner.

I am cut off—no contact for life! *If we cant be in a relationship atleast we could still remain friends?* God knows how many times I must repeated this line begging and pleading her to stay.

# the relationship
My girlfriend (18) and I (18) started dating 2 years ago at 16 back in high school. We've had a very turbulent relationship with a lot of breaking and making up, intense love and our fair share of troubles. Maybe I'm just romanticizing the word toxicity but to be completely honest I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.
We used to be extremely jealous of each other and sort of isolated our self from the world together. Thinking back I do regret this a lot. Due to our mix of toxicity and her depression we both suffered abuse from each other. It's crazy how an extreme love for a certain person can drive you insane and even make you do unloveable things to them.
In high school we used to spend almost everyday together and I loved it this changed after we went to college. When we graduated high school she went to Sweden for 7 weeks and we really started having a lot of relationship difficulties from there. I sort of started disconnecting and getting used to having more space. After she returned we noticed that we had both changed a lot and this led to a lot of fights but slowly but surely we kind of started having a healthy relationship. This took a lot of hard work, sacrifice and communication.
Everything changed when this happened however. Around the first year of the relationship we both promised each other to stop watching porn because it made us insecure. I did this for a long time but eventually relapsed around 8 times in the span of a year and never told her. She eventually had a suspicion and confronted me, I confessed and everything just went extremely downhill from there. She was really hurt and even more so about the fact that I hid it from her and was never planning on telling. We broke up after this but got back together after a couple weeks had gone by. Her trust however was never the same (and rightfully so).
# Her situation/depression
My girlfriend originally started suffering from depression at 16 due to her birth control pills. I've been supporting her ever since. The first months it was really bad and she even tried taking her own life with sleeping pills she saved up. I called emergency services when this happened and she was taken to the hospital and given mental treatment after this all happened. There was a big problem however when she came home.
After hating me for a couple of days and wishing that I didn't call emergency services she finally told me the real reason why she wanted to die. It turns out that she was a gypsy, a Romani. And in their culture children have to be in arranged marriages at extremely young ages. Now its 16/18 but it used to be a lot younger. And it has to be with another gypsy otherwise the female is considered a whore and an outsider and is shunned by the entire family. I always thought that my girlfriend had strict parents but never to this extent I never asked any questions about why they couldn't know about us but now I knew.
She always had a really good relationship with her mom but after the day she tried to commit suicide their relationship was strained for a very long time. Her mother (father is out of the picture) didn't believe in mental health and thought she was doing this to get attention which of course triggered my girlfriend even more. She also could never tell the full story to her mental health counselors because they would have to enable child protective services.
She eventually made the choice to run away with me. But she seemed very conflicted about this and kind of flip flopped between staying with her mom and living for her and being with me. A lot of the times she did not want to make a choice because she felt she would be unhappy in both situations. A loveless (probably abusive) arranged marriage or an unstable relationship with me. She convinced herself dying was the best option eventually. I talked her out of it so many times and truly tried supporting her through everything. This took a large toll on me as she would often be really abusive.
Everything changed when I cheated however. She told me in the weeks that we broke up that I was the reason she was going to die and I was her only chance at a normal life. I tried to convince her otherwise but she just won't listen. After we got back together she told me she was going to die regardless of her relationship and she's just waiting for the right time. When I begged her not to she refused to change her choice and told me it was going to happen this year and I get to choose to be with her till the end or leave. When I asked why she said because I cheated and we would never be the same after this anyway.
I thought I could change her mind at first but I can't. I honestly don't know what to do anymore I see a future with this girl but she doesn't with me. I told her I'm going to think about my choice and she called me selfish. Supporting her through all of those years of this took a toll on my sanity,sleep and social life. I can't sit there and be with her until she dies. I don't understand how she wants to take me back after everything but doesn't want to run away with me anymore. I'm confused tired and stressed out. I've never talked about this with anyone and I just need to hear someone else's opinion on this.
# My final decision
I still havent decided what to do and told her I want to think about this long and hard. She told me I was selfish and compared me to the devil for leaving her with the depression and letting her die alone. I really need some advice.
I really don't want to be a temporary comfort for her I just can't. I love her to death and want to grow old with her and have a good relationship. I would permanently lose my sanity if I stayed I'm afraid but I also don't want to leave her like this.
I know a large part of our relationship troubles seem really immature and they are. But we were both really young and we still are and these are all just extremely hard choices to make at this age.
TL;DR: My girlfriend is going to kill herself and wants me to be with her till the end. I'm conflicted on what to do.",1
dev_pid_2012,"I need to take this off my chest or I fear the guilt is going to eat me alive : This is a long story but I will summarize it at my best.
I grew up with my mother. I stopped seeing my father reguarly at 5. He was not a good parent either way, it's like he missed emotions or couldn't show them, and in the last year I went from seeing him as a stranger to someone I actually hate because of the way he reacted after I came out. I can still recall him implying there's something perverted in me.
My mother is not that good either, despire being supportive of this, she was never uplifting in my childhood, rarely I was given support when I made errors, rather she would get mad and tell me often things were my fault. I was legit scared of her and felt like I had to walk on eggshells, because I knew she could snap for things as little as ""what hour is it?"". I don't have many memories of my childhood, I forgot most of what happened and therefore it's hard to tell how my parents were when I was a child, however I can still feel the effects on my mind. To this day, everytime someone is mad, even if not at me, in the same room as me, and the slightly raise their voice or become irritated, I can't help but start panicking and shake.
But in the end, except for my difficulty relationing to people and my fear of imminent abandonment and speaking up for myself, I never had severe problems.
I saw the first sign of something getting worst after I got dumped by my ex in november 2019. It was quick and unexpected, but I foresaw it, panicking the day before, fearing he would leave despite having no proof. It turned out my paranoia was right.
I quickly forgot about him (our relationship was long-distance and lasted only 1 month and a half) and started dating a friend's friend, and he's really someone I want in my life: he's kind-hearted, creative, outgoing, funny, protective and ready to help with my mental illnesses. A human dog basically, and when I lay next to him or on his chest I feel a feeling of peace and happiness I hardly ever felt, but there's flaws too, and that is he's interested in open-relationships where I'm extremely monogamous. He made it clear that he thinks that consent is the most important thing and he wouldn't force anyone in an open relationship, however, because of the fact that we are still dating he still talks to people online to roleplay sexual scenarios. This worries me more than it hurts, as I fear of losing him to someone else who might be better.
My friends (who have knew him for years) reassure me he's really into me and he himself told me he's not romantically interested in anyone else, and that sex and love are separated to him, but I can't stop feeling like I'm not good enough and I can be replaced any time. I know I have an obsessive and co-dependant type of love and once I find someone I really like I don't want to let go and I feel like I'm dying without that person.
This is just the tip of the iceberg however.
Both me and him are very sexual people, but I have a very unhealthy view of sex: I have a very typical high male libido and I masturbate daily only to keep it down, but to do it I have to distract myself. If being scared of being touched because I'm extremely disgusted by my body wasn't enough, I have to redirect my sexual fantasies to pleasing others, because, if I think about pleasing myself too, I will feel a terrible sense of guilt and shame from it that will break me in tears. I can't help but feel like I'm not supposed to have sexual feelings, and that they make me dirty and perverted, that it's wrong and I must feel ashamed of it and hide them.
I also have constant fanstasies about being in a relationship where I get beaten, pushed and yelled at to the point my mind breaks and I kill myself, or I straight up get beaten to death. When I talk about it people assume it's some masochistic fantasy, however I derive zero pleasure from it, only pain. I can't imagine myself being happy and loved because I feel like I don't deserve it and that there's something wrong with me that makes me unlovable.
I also fantasize about being violently raped, or to have sex when I don't want to just to please my partner without him knowing. Another one is being mistreated during sex, not to feel pleasure, but as punishment for being dirty and disgusting by having sex.
I also started feeling suspicious of everyone after my breakup. I feel like I can't trust anyone (friends included, not only romantic partners) and that they are all after me, wanting to hurt me, use me, and that I somehow deserve it because I'm ""bad and unpure"".
This is killing me, and I can't tell all of this to the guy I'm dating because I feel like a burden, but it still makes me feel like I don't deserve him, or his affection. When I'm with him I forget everything and everyone, but the moment after he leaves I feel all the bad feelings back at it again, and I feel like I HAVE to run away or he, or someone else, is too going to hurt me.
Sometimes all I can think about is cutting my wrists or throat open or banging my head against the wall or table to death. I fear of cutting myself too because if he sees it he'll feel sad for me and I don't want to put stress over him. Despite him being so, soo patient as a person, I still feel like everything might make him mad and make him leave me, or that if I say the wrong word when he's angry at someone he'll snap at me.
I'm extremely in love with him, but all this pain makes me feel like I should drop off because I'll just become a burden on him, and that in the future he'll just be with me because he feels pity for me not being able to go on alone due to depression, and that I'll end up alone.
I just need to take this weight off my chest because I can't bear it anymore.
Thank you for anyone who has came so far.",1
dev_pid_2013,"Extreme repulsion when people cares or shows me affection : I have no idea what's wrong with me. I desire the love of people, I desire affection or understanding, but when it happens I feel so gross.
I never been a person that likes physical affection; I like the idea of it.
I think I have idolized the concept of family, romantic love or friendship; in my fantasies all those things feel right. 
But in reality I just can't handle it. I been telling to myself that one day i'll find what i'm looking for. I will know when I see it... The place where I belong, people that i can connect to. 
It's all lies, isn't? 
I feel like an outsider, I know I shouldn't been here, this world is wrong.
I can't love my family, friends, anyone. The repulsion is too strong.

dev_pid_2016,"Self care made me lose my best friend : I usually let people walk all over me but about 2 months ago I was feeling brave. I decided to stop being a pushover and actually try to care about myself and my mental stability. My best friend and i, or I guess I should say ex best friend now, had plans and for about the hundredth time she pushed me aside for some dick and a couple bucks. She even made me be third wheel on my birthday. So I called her out on it and we haven't talked since. I wish I never had the courage to stand up for myself. Now she's out partying with some new people and I'm home alone feeling worthless and abandoned and it's my own fault. I really thought our friendship was strong enough to withstand a little fight about boys but I was wrong. I guess being someones bestfriend for 15 years means nothing. Being there for them when they were going through the foster system means nothing. Being welcomed in by my entire family as if she was one of us means nothing. Even the family members that don't like me love her and ask about her constantly. I wish I could go back to that moment... I wish I had kept my mouth shut...

dev_pid_2017,"So tired : I wake up exhausted every day. I have to fight myself to get out of bed in the morning (or afternoon or evening). I go to school and fight to stay awake in class. Sometimes I lose. 
I get told that it's just me being a teenager, that I need to get more sleep, etc. I can go to bed at 8 pm, wake up at 6 am (that's like 10 hours, right?) and still feel exhausted. On weekends, I'll sleep for 16 hours straight (or more). I've tried changing how much sleep I get, since I've heard oversleeping can make you tired. I tried to get 8 hours a night, no more. Then I tried 6. Then 4. Then I said fuck it and went back to that ""normal"" 10 hours on school nights.
I've grown tired of dealing with entire classes of people. I sit upstairs in the guidance office, just outside my therapist's office, in case I can't handle the 4 other kids in there at a time. I'm falling behind in my work. I have 3 assignments due last Wednesday that I haven't even started. The end of the quarter is this Thursday. I've got a pile of work sitting on my kitchen table. I'll take out a paper, stare at it, try to think about what the questions are asking, and fall asleep. I can't focus. Writing this post is the most work I've done in weeks.
I woke up a bit over an hour ago. I'm still tired. I've hardly moved. I have no desire to get up and take care of myself. I faked being asleep as I listened to my mom talk about how she wishes she were dead, how she deserves all the suffering she experiences, how get kids are ungrateful, how I would rather sleep my day away than lift a finger to do anything productive, how my older sister would rather be out with her friends than spend time with her family, how my little sister better be ""normal"" and not have anything mentally wrong with her, that my dad should just cheat again already so she'll have a reason to leave. Sorry Mom, that my big sister suffers with depression and use to self harm. Sorry that I've attempted suicide more times than you'll ever know. Sorry that you rely on my younger sister as your ""last hope."" Sorry that you decided to marry an asshole after he cheated on you while you were pregnant. Sorry that your husband cares more about his alcohol and his video games than he does about any of us. Sorry that we're such a burden on you.
People tell me I can't be depressed, I'm only 16, I don't have anxiety, I'm just nervous, I don't have OCD because my rooms messy, I don't have PTSD, that's only for people who have been to war. Bullshit. How else can I explain the suicidal thoughts always on my mind? How else can I explain the lack of motivation to do anything other than sleep? The panic attacks? The urge to touch the desk the same way with each arm? The desire to only use certain numbers when doing miscellaneous tasks? The flashbacks I'm bombarded with every day? How can you argue with a professional's diagnosis? How can you know more about me and how my mind works than I do?
I'm tired of trying to get better. I've been trying to be happy for almost 10 years now. There have been a few ""ups"" where I'm happy for a day, a week, once almost an entire month. It always comes crashing down. I'm on the verge of giving up. I'm on the verge of abandoning this life. I'm on the verge of tears all the time. On the verge of another breakdown every day. 
It feels like I'm sitting on the edge of the world and looking down into darkness. I look behind me, and I see a world full of nothing but pain, suffering, and sorrow. I look up to the sky and see clouds blocking out the light of the stars. I look back down and I wonder if I should jump, just to see what the darkness holds.

dev_pid_2028,"Starvation, humiliation and abuse... : Can anyone relate to being neglected as a child? For me, this one of the core bricks of my depression, and the ""ghosts"" that follow me every day... 
Me and my sister were raised in a chaotic household, without the money needed to take care of two children. My dad in particular could become extremely angry over anything. He was and still is an alcoholic, and spend tremendous amounts of money on cigarettes and booze instead of feeding us. I often found myself hiding behind curtains and other places, eating one-dollar baguettes or anything i could find. He and his parents ""my grandparents"" where quick to defend him at any cost.
Constant warfare between the two sides of my family made me chose sides, and who to align myself with in the next shitstorm of family drama. I was and still am extremely loyal, and will do anything someone tells me just to avoid trouble. 
As i said my mom and my dad didn't get along and often fought over who should have have us the most, and this often resulted in things becoming very heated, my dad would often chase me  on the way home to my mom, just because he was bitter over the fact that i went to my mom more than him. I know he did track where i walked because we often conveniently ""meet"" me in ally ways, and different places of the town where he never drove or would have any reason to drive to, hi used this ""convenience to drive me back to his place without my say"". 
one time he and my grandparents almost rammed my sister and my mom off the road, in an argument over a party she had been to or something, when they lost them they went back home where i was gaming minecraft and started to whale on me instead, saying that i was on their side and we where disgusting people and so forth..... honestly i don't remember much as it was this episode that left me with possible PTSD, as one doctor has said to me, but its not confirmed so.... I often prayed to god to kill me at the age of eight, as i was mentally exhausted. 
The police became involved several times, but nothing came of it as my dad is a master manipulator and always manages to get out of those situations, like this one time where he flirted with one of the inspectors of child protective services.   
Bulling is also something that has stuck with me, the humiliation of public bulling in school is the one of the worst things i have ever experienced. I can take a beating, and having been kicked by my class mates to unconsciousness, i can say that humiliation is worse. Standing in-front of the class and having people laugh at you, leaves a sense of shame that you cant get rid off. 
I moved from home about half year ago and started my higher education, but all of my experiences has left me a anxious wreck, if for example someone touches me without me knowing, something like a pat on the back or a loud noise. Will trigger many kinds of reactions a out fear, and if i become stressed out i often get a panic attack. 
this just starches the surface of what i have experienced, with abusive relationships and more, hopefully you guys can relate, i haven't really had many friends at all so haven't been able to compare my childhood wit anyone else, wonder if i am over reacting or not.

This is my first time writing here, so I'm sorry if there's something wrong. I would like to say that I'll mention suicide too (nothing explicit!!), so if this triggers you, please, don't read.
I've been feeling like this for so, so long that I don't even know when I'm okay and when I'm not.
I feel that everytime I'm just feeling anxious, depressed, lost and confused between all of the sensations and interactions or just very very numb. Some days I can't even feel my own body (I feel pressure, but not the sensation of touch), and sincerely, I don't know what it is, but it's kind of comforting. I don't like being here, I don't like feeling empty like this every time, so being here, but not feeling like, sometimes it's better than the other options for me.
Sometimes I feel really suicidal. I won't talk about it in details because it's against the rules here and because I really don't want to thrigger anyone if someone reads this. But sometimes it's just an ideia, a wish, and sometimes feels like the only way to stop feeling like this.
And the problem is that even if I'm not feeling suicidal, I still feel bad. Some days more, other less, but it's here. It's always here. And I don't know if I should ask for help.
I don't think that I can be helped, because there's not something making me feel like this, this is just how I am, and I don't want to make anyone worry about me or lose their time with me.
And also, I don't know if it's worth it asking for help. I mean, I've felt so much worse, I've been so close to worst situations, and I didn't ask for help at the time. Why should I ask now? Why should I bother others if I've handled worst times by myself?
How bad is bad enough? If I'm not going to kill myself, should I ask for help? 
I don't want to bother anyone, but sometimes I'm just so tired and everything hurst so, so much. I don't want to hurt other people, I don't want to make them deal with my pain, because I know that they have theirs too.
I think this is part of why I'm posting here. Anyone has to answer, anyone has to deal with me. But it's so bad, I just want to take it out of my mind.
I'm just tired of feeling this pain of being myself and this void that seems to never let me go. I'm tired of feeling depressed in silence, because it hurts to seem okay all the time, and I'm scared to tell anyone.
I'm sorry if you read until here. This was just me talking about being tired, and not wanting to tell others about it, so I'm sorry.",1
dev_pid_2035,"I'm thinking about locking myself in the bathroom and slitting my wrists. : Ever since I withdrew from college after doing poorly for the last year and a half and lying about it to my parents, my life has been going down the shitter. I live with my dad and stepmom in the middle of nowhere in Maryland, where the closest apartments to my work are 1,000 dollars a month, and the cheapest apartments I'd need at least two jobs to afford to rent. I suggested to my parents that I'd move out by mid-April, not knowing how hard the search would be. My parents are supportive, but I can tell that their love for me is waning after how I've behaved with them. They are often cold towards me, not even saying hello. Even if I told them what I was going through mentally, they would call me lazy and tell me to get over it. The only thing that's keeping me from ending it all are my outstanding student loans that would take years for me to pay off, and that I have no desire to leave my parents to pay it off as that would be adding insult to grievous injury. I'm running out of options.",1
dev_pid_2036,"Possibly unpopular opinion: DO NOT get a kitten if you have depression! It can trigger you REAL bad. : I thought getting a kitten to keep me company and be my little best friend would be an amazing idea to battle depression. It wasn't. Most times it's great, but others, the kitten acts very weirdly, not to say aggressive and in many ways it feels he doesn't like you and wants to keep some manner of distance or personal space. Because cats are very independent, and especially young kittens are quite active, playful and don't dig being hugged and cuddled that much instead of being left free to run around, sometimes you just want to show the little guy some affection and then he bites your hand and runs away, sits as far away as possible from you and if you try to interact with him (by talk) in any way, he swishes his tail REALLY strong like he's absolutely pissed with you. It hurts quite bad to show affection and love to this little cute creature 24/7 and in return get these responses sometimes. Note that they aren't always like this, but these situations DO happen and they can make your depression worse. 
In the end, I gave my kitten to a shelter, because the recurrence of this situation was driving me insane and extremely unhappy. You give love, a roof, warmth, food and fresh water to this new friend that you truly love and try your best to pet and cuddle, and these sudden bursts of ""hey, I fucking hate you, leave me alone for some time please"" inside your very house can be truly bad. This whole episode made me a worse mess than I previously was, because regardless of those incidents I was attached to the kitten and now I have to deal with the feeling even an animal despised me and I had to give him away. 
I'm not saying my situation is universal and everyone will have the same experience, but please be aware that a kitten might show some behaviors that hurt your feelings real good if you have depression.",1

dev_pid_2039,"I miss you anyways. : This is a re-post of something that i have posted already in other place. After all of this i still even miss those people who hurt me bad.
This starts at 2018. I was 15/16 years old at the moment. In that time i was a very... particular kid. I didn´t like to be around people because i used to feel them as idiots or douchebags. (Most of my classmates, used a lot of homophobic terms, racists stuff, and they all were very religious) So.
I found a group of people who were nice. And where kinda like me. The group had 4 girls and 3 boys. (One of the boys and 2 of the girls were from others classes) so. After a time, i started to have feelings for one of the girls. After a time i decided to confess to her my feelings. And well... she rejected me. And i was ok with it. Everyone can do whatever they want (If they´re not hurting anyone) she told me that, i don´t have anything wrong but that she doesn´t want to have anything serious. And we were both okay with that. A week later... she started to date a guy who didn´t use soap... (And, yeah. He kinda smelled like shit) At the end of 2019. Our group was kinda broken. We were only 2 females and 2 males. (She, a friend of her, my best friend and I) Well. In 2019 i started to.... feel things for her again, and i was worried. Bc i didn´t want to leave the group because of my stupid feelings. So i tell my best friend about that. After some time... HE started dating her. .-.
So yeah. My best friend and my crush... at my backs... yeah... they both knowning everything. For weeks i felt like trash and cried a lot. They kinda ""apologized"" (But, they wasn´t like.... really trying to feel sorry. They were just being polite) and after a time they broke up. Their relationship was not going well.
Weeeeelll.... she was feeling pretty bad, all the time and i told her that EVEN if she had been a piece of shit with me, i will be there for her. And she kinda took it well, and started to talk to me every day.
After a week or so, she told me that she was planning on harming him or herself. So i kinda freaked out. (I wasn´t in my country at the time) So. After i call her like 20 times. bc her last message was a ""Sorry"" and disconnect. I heard that she kinda hurt herself. I blame him for that, and when i was in home again and we all meet in school. (Well, when i meet them again in school. They already were talking and stuff) Like.
They were GOOD FRIENDS AGAIN. LIKE WTF?
First, you make my best friend betray me. Second, my best friend end with my crush. Three, she kinda talk nice to me, 4 everything is about to go down and finally... they are good friends again.
After a time guess what.
She blocked me, without explanation or something.
And i blocked the one who was my best friend.

dev_pid_2040,"Everyday i have less desire to be alive/do something with my life : First of all Sorry, im not native english and sometimes i write like shit.
I went to the wc and discovered that im bleeding in the same part few years ago. That time i was operated and couldnt move out of the bed like 1 month and then another month to recover. Probably going to happen the same this year, and when i remember how were those months i just want to live in another world or being another person. The part of being in home 2 months i guess i can hold it, but it hitted me hard that no one of my friends asked how i feel or something. I really don't want to pass throught that. i know my friends since 2014 (collegue, with 13-14 years). I'm probably paranoidc with this but i don't know what to do when i see all my friends meeting/hanging out,uploading stories in instagram and they didn't asked me to go, i didn't ask them never why, because im scared as fuck of  the answer. Im an anti social, shy, dont know how to start conversations, dont know to do new friends, all shit. One that hitted me hard was a birthday 3 weeks ago, All meet in a friend's house to celebrate the birthday with close friends and i was the only one that didn't go. I knew about this the next day when went to a fast food because they wanted to meet to celebrate the birthday, all of them. idk. As i said i started to think that im mad or stupid or paranoid. these 2 things kill me. I didn't go to the next level, starting self harming because the only thing that safe me is my family and my exgirlfriend (when was my gf). I never tell this to my family because i dont want to make more problems, they gave me all  i could revive 1000 times but i wont have a family like this. i just started to cry writing this.

dev_pid_2041,"I dont know where else to turn, I’m completely hopeless : Its been months on end of feeling depressed now, I still have 7 months on the waiting list before I can see a psychiatrist and today I’ve completely lost it.
I was up early this morning, I sat at the window and watched the sunrise and for the first time in months I felt happy, and hopeful that I can feel like this again. I was feeling so motivated, I decided I wanted to take the dog out for a nice long walk and just enjoy the nice day and the happy feeling.
My boyfriend and I have only just gotten around to walking the dog (had a nap after staying up all night) and now its a miserable day. Its rainy and gross and I havent stopped crying over it for an hour now. I swear I physically felt the hope and happiness being ripped away from me.

dev_pid_2042,"Recovery??? :  Hi, hello, first time in reddit. Hello! Some profanity and some references to sex ahead (plus depression and suicide and suicidal ideation), so I'm tagging this NSFW I guess?
So, I'm having a bit of a think here about my current situation and honestly, this issue is not a bad problem to have. As in, I feel bad that this is something I’m complaining about, here of all places, but I’m feeling kinda lost. A lot lost. I don't know if I need some advice or just to put this in writing so I can look at it in the form of words rather than manic anxiety and internal screaming. I suspect this is going to be really f\*\*\*\*\*g long, so very sorry about that. Hope some of you stick with me to the end.
Ok so context: I have a few mental health issues, most notably big time depression which has an organic cause. That means it doesn’t necessarily originate from any life event, and instead is an inescapable, life-long and not-very-treatable condition that results from my brain being wired like shit. Over the past 15 years or so (I’m 29) I’ve been steadily isolating myself and I never really learned how to form like personal connections beyond the shallowest kind (and those were mostly by proxy. Friends of friends, stuff like that). I did try to kill myself at one point, a few years ago, when I was at a specially low point. And it turns out I’m really bad at suicide, which is probably the only reason I haven’t tried again yet because if you try and fail to kill yourself there’s a lot of drama and it’s exhausting. And honestly I don't have the energy to try and make a life I'm content with, it just sounds too... too much.
And since then, well… I’d mostly accepted that being alive wasn’t something that I liked very much. I derive(d) very little pleasure from anything, endlessly tortured myself psychologically because when I felt bad at least I felt something, and didn’t have much of an interest in completing my education, finding a job, moving out of my parents’ home… Y’know, just generally having a life. I had sort of accepted, in a truly chill way, that I was merely existing between depressive episodes and that the next one very well could be the one to push me over the edge, so why bother? I was going to die, and honestly it was going to be soon, and there were means and there was planning. Most of the time, going through life without an escape plan (by which I mean suicide) was simply impossible. Like, I probably wouldn’t have lived to see August. I was considering my birthday, which on the one hand has the very nifty way of reducing peak grief days for my family and stuff, but on the other hand commiting suicide on your 30th birthday is just like ugh.
AND THEN, like a month ago, it just fucking went away. Like, I’m not FINE fine, but for the first time since I can remember I’m in a genuine, sort of stable good mood. I have energy, I am making some (SOME) good choices, I want to surround myself with people. For the first time in my life I’m thinking that maybe it would be nice to have a job, one that pays just well enough to move out and live with roomates or something. Learn how to deal with people, because currently I just don’t know how to people, and perhaps one day have a romantic relationship. Or several!
I’m not going to lie, I didn’t exactly welcome this change. I don’t know where it came from (I’ll get there sorry this is so long), or what to do with all that energy, or what I’m feeling most of the time because I have no context for any of this emotions. And a little later I just started to be terrified, all of the time, that one day it’s going to go away and never come back. I’m still terrified and confused and all that, but somehow it doesn’t detract from my good mood because now I’m a positive person I guess. Disgusting.
OKAY, that was context, so sorry for the rant. Here comes another one.
So around the time this started, I was starting to hang out a bit more often with some friends of friends, always as a group. I like them very much, and I knew one of them beforehand. He’s really nice and the kind of person I would really like to hang out one-on-one (which we have, once, I think) if I knew how to like bond with people and talk to them just because, and if one-on-one weren’t such a terrifying thing. Kind of a mess, he is, but like in a sometimes endearing way. A bit sitcomy I guess. And while I honestly don’t know (because I don’t know anything anymore), I’m starting to fear that I might have a bit of a crush on him, which would be all-around terrible for several reasons.
First, feelings? Gross. I’ve rarely liked a guy. Hell, I haven’t ever kissed a boy I had feelings for. I’ve kissed many, fucked even more (rarely good, rarely worth it, always punishing), but never one I actually wanted to kiss. I don’t know if I know how to do that.
Second, I’m happy but I’m not an idiot. If this is actually a crush, nothing good is ever going to come out of it. No way no how.
Third, timing. I was going to die, by my hand, soon, and now I have a new lease on life. Can you imagine that my sudden change is because I like a boy? It would be so sad, and really dangerous, and again so very sad. And I’m fine now, but what if I start wallowing about it? I can’t afford that.
So I’ve come to the conclusion that me having a crush on this dude is:
* Really gross.
* Potentially lethal (for me).
* Ugh.
And like I said, I truly don’t think I’m in denial. I honestly don’t know and I’ve come (as I write this) to the very reasonable conclusion that the answer better be “no”. And I can’t tell, I really can’t tell. Yes, I feel sort of funky when I hear about his relationships and crushes and romantic connections, but honestly that doesn’t tell me much because I’ve always felt bad when hearing about blossoming new romances and shit, because it brings out many of my own insecurities.
I guess this is it? Oh, man.
TL;DR: I have depression, anxiety and a few other stuff going on, I don’t really have the energy or motivation to try to do anything about that, was planning to kill myself soon and then one day out of the blue I felt a lot better. Didn’t like it, didn’t understand it, live in fear it’s going to go away and never come back, now I don’t understand my own emotions most of the time. Because of timing I’m afraid I might possibly have a crush and that’s why I feel better, because that would suck real bad.",1
dev_pid_2043,"Overthinking... : I’m 18(m) but I’m always told I’m mature for my age. I’ve been sort of talking with this girl recently over text and seeing her fairly often and it’s been flirty and forward. We’ve kissed but nothing more. However last night I was at a party and went back to a friends hosue afterwards with a few other people. There were 3 guys and 3 girls including me and so as teenagers normally would, we sort of paired up and each sat next to one of the girls. About 15 minutes into the film she put my arm around her and she started to lean on me, which I took as a sign that she felt comfortable. This girl is beautiful, not ‘standard’ beauty. Messier hair, baggy jumper and tracksuit but something about it was beautiful. As the movie progressed we got more and more intimate untill we were spooning or whatever. We made out and that’s it. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve spent all day thinking about it. For example I play football every Sunday and normally it takes my mind of things, like whenever a wave of depression hits me (I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder) and I go onto a football pitch everything brightens up within my head and I feel light and free, but this morning I really really didn’t. I felt weighed down and burdened by it all. I really really enjoy spending time with the girl I’m kind of seeing at the moment and we always have a laugh and it’s always fun. But the girl I “hooked up with” last night makes me fight a smile every time I hear her name or think of her. I can’t stop thinking about what I should do and whether it meant more to me than it did to her. I can’t stop thinking about how I can find that out or what my next move should be. It’s all so grey at the moment. There is a massive weight on my shoulders but I can’t get it off. I feel like I’m drowning in my own thoughts and that I can’t breath properly.",1

dev_pid_2046,"I have felt so bad lately and I really need some help : This is my first time posting here and I think I need some advice or something.
So for some backstory my childhood wasn't the greatest. I've been a huge fan of games and movies since I was a little child and yeah I usually got what I wanted but that's not the point here. When I was 5 or 6 years old my mother met her new man and they started dating and so on. Soon after they started to date he was all over me not like in sexual manner but he used to hit me and keep my head underwater and lock me in sauna and even kept me from eating sometimes. And he always did these things when I did something that he thought was wrong like not  cleaning up my room, being late or if I didn't do any homeworks. And he even did it in front of my mom sometimes and she did nothing to prevent it they even had a kid and got married. Of course when my step brother was born i got blame for every little mistake that I made and If my brother fell over then I got the blame and I was hit by my stepfather. Only one who believed me when I told about this was my dad's aunt who was my best friend and who always had my back but she was really old like 80 but she was everything to me back then because I didn't have any friends and I have always been that lonely kid.
When I grew up my dad's aunt died and soon after my grandmother and those two were really important to me and I didn't even cry when they died because all that I felt was deep emptiness that I still feel to this day even though I don't want to admit it. It left a deep void in me that I have tried to fill up for years and sometimes it has worked and I have felt happy but soon after it has only gone downhill. After my ''real'' first relationship in 9th grade ended when she cheated on me and went with another one and soon after that I have always felt really not so good about myself and I even thought about killing myself because life just felt so worthless but then came this another girl who first understood me and tried to help me and she did for a while and so we ended up talking for many months before we started to date and that was the worst relationship that I had ever had because it involved a lot of arguments and she blamed me about everything and I reacted the wrong way and I cheated on her and it left me with so much guilt that after few months it told her about it and I wanted to break up and so after that I avoided relationships and pretty much any human contact for 6 months until a new girl came into my life and we dated for few months and we broke up because I was a real mess and after few months we decided to try again and everything was going on really good until my mental issues surfaced and they pretty much messed up everything.
Well few months I was diagnosed with depression and OCD and I sometimes i get these intrusive thoughts that makes me question everything in my life but mostly it focuses on my relationship. Like those thoughts range from ''You don't feel for her anymore'', ''You don't love her anymore'' to ''just end this relationship'' and it makes me question that do I have feelings for her still. Sometimes I get this feeling of deep emptiness and sometimes it comes when I am alone and when I am with her and it scares the hell out of me. Like I want to enjoy my life with her but my mind struggles so hard to make me feel like that I don't want to be with her anymore and sometimes it feels so real that I even start to believe it. I have told her about these and she has promised to help me in anyway that she can so she is very understanding. This is also concerning to me because we haven't had any problems in our relationship and soon we have dated for a year. She was my ex before but we broke up because I was acting like an asshole and she still had feelings towards her ex so we broke up but then I didn't know about it even though I asked her many times. And when we got back together she didn't tell me about it and I had to find out myself and I felt really bad because she lied to me back then but now everything has been fine in our relationship and we have both worked on those old issues and are no longer keeping secrets but I can't find out why I feel like this. Like is this because of my mental problems or is this relationship genuinely not good? Sometimes I feel like ending everything would be a good choice because then I wouldn't have to feel anything anymore and just be gone from everyones life.",1
dev_pid_2047,"What a horrible thing for a psychiatrist to say to someone with depression : I have terrible grammar but I will try to express this the best I can.
I have always had a difficult time in school, it's like I lack the ability to study.  I can read the same paragraph 3-4 times and still have no clue what I just read.  In the late 2000s (and my late 30s), I finally got fed up and spoke to my doctor for advise.  He referred me to a psychiatrist and when I sat with her, I explained how much I want to go back to school to better myself but lack the tools to learn.  I told her I contacted a learning center but just the consultation would cost me nearly $1000, I could never imagine having that kind of money.  After explaining all of this to the psychiatrist, she told me I should just accept the person I am and that (and I quote) ""higher learning is not for everyone"" and to stop wasting time or money as this is all I will ever be.
I felt so heart broken and lost and here we are, 12-13 years later, I am still holding on to this.  I completely gave up believing what parents and teachers always told us, ""You can do whatever you put your mind to"".  I became angry at my parents, why mislead people telling them you can do whatever you put your mind to when an ""EXPERT"" basically told me not to thrive for something more.....BUT I have this feeling deep inside of me that I cannot explain...I just want to scream so loud.  I have such a strong desire to be more, to do more with my life.  I hate my job so much, I am so frikkin bored at work all day but I feel like this is all I'll ever be good at.  
One of my closest friends is trying to get me a job interview with her company and she truly believes I will excel at it but I am being self-destructive and it's like I am trying to get her to change her mind and forget about the referral. I tell myself she is just being nice, I will embarrass her, I will fail, they will let me go within a couple months and then I will be completely out of a job.
I really do want this job, it's been such a long time since I have desired something this bad but anxiety and depression keeps getting in the way.

dev_pid_2048,"I lost the love of my life. Now life is pretty much over! : 
I’ve been separated from my wife for the past two month, we have been together for 14 years. (Married for 3). We have 2 amazing children together.
I admit I haven’t been the best husband or dad. I’ve taken them all for granted. I should have realised that I was being an arsehole a lot sooner. I spent too much time working rather than spending time with my beautiful family. Used to come in late from work and just fall asleep and not have time for anyone. My wife and I used to argue about loads of different things, like money and bills. I was a shit person, I made her feel shit unintentionally. I love her with the whole of my heart.
When we separated I had so much time to think about all the shit stuff that I had done. So I made loads of changes, spent less time in the office, started collecting kids from school, taking the kids out for dinner. I’ve lots loads of weight, because I’m working out, I’m paying for PT sessions. I genuinely believe I have changed my whole lifestyle to be a better person. 
Unfortunately this wasn’t enough for her. She doesn’t want me back. She said it’s a little too late. This is killing me so much. All I want is to hug her again. She is the love of my life. I miss her so much! I just want to be able to treat her like she should be treated. I’ve realised now what i should have been doing. She’s not having any of it. 
Now I have major regret. I’m in a dark place. I feel worthless. I’ve been to the doctor, they said that I have severe depression. It’s a big dark hole that I feel like I cannot get out of. I can’t function properly day to day. She told me to tell the kids it’s all my fault, she said the kids are not bothered wether I’m not there, they don’t ask for me etc. 
The kids are the only positive thing I have let in my life.
I don’t know what to do anymore. Will it ever get better? I feel like I don’t need to be around anymore. 
I feel like there’s nothing left for me now. Constant memories are making me feel shit all day everyday. I think that now she might be seeing someone else. So that means there would be no way for me to go back to the only love of my life.

I have to put on a shell in front of people, because I won't seem very presentable if I act down, even though it's the only thing I do well. I just need a break from something. Thanks for reading my vent session.",1
dev_pid_2051,"pangs of loneliness and purposelessness : I had a lot of fun the past two days. It felt really nice to hang out with friends and really just remembering how close of a friends we are. How can it be, that I feel so lonely, purposeless and empty now? Out of the blue. Lately I've been realizing how much my life will change. Today, I logged my expenses and income of the past five months. I figured out how big of a student loan I'm gonna take out. I responded to some dorm listings. Studied for a bit. I thought, what if I fail out of my study program? If I don't make any friends and just do nothing all day? Am I gonna waste my life, that's already insignificant? I don't know.",1
dev_pid_2052,"My mom is a sociopath and I can't help but to wonder what my life could've been like if I had normal parents. : I grew up with incredibly loving, but strict parents, an amazing older sister, and an older brother with whom I am not close to. My mother and I always had a great relationship (as great as it can get hen you are only discussing school and leaving out every personal feeling and thought because you know your mom will never understand). It was obvious that I was their favorite; I was spoiled rotten. My relationship with my dad was loving and nice, but we never really talked. There was no depth. However, it was not like that with my mom. We talked about school and my friends, but I never felt comfortable talking about my personal life with her because she was incredibly judgmental. I kept a lot of things to myself, or I would share them with my sister. She is my best friend, and has always been kind of a second mom to me, something my mother was always jealous of. In all honesty, I, and much of my family members believe my mother has a mental illness (my sister and I have diagnosed her with being a sociopath after a lot of research and reminiscing), however she refuses to acknowledge it. All in all, my life was not perfect, but it was a good life filled with family and friends. 
I met my best friend in 6th grade, but we did not become true best friends until high school. We were inseparable; I was either at her house, or she at mine. We told each other everything, as best friends do. We even had similarly strict mothers, so we could relate to each other in that aspect. We always talked about living together when we went off to college, to get an apartment together to have our freedom, but we knew our mothers would never approve. So we planned in secret.
As I said, my mother and I had a good relationship. I was always a good child. I was terrified of getting in trouble, and never disobeyed my parents. It was not until my senior year of high school that I could see our relationship changing for the worse. My mother became even more strict, nosey, and suspicious. I wanted my freedom, and she wanted nothing more than to keep me locked in our house with as little freedom as possible. The last thing she ever wanted was for me to have my own life and leave her and my dad. Needless to say, the older I got, the harder it was to live in that house.
In 2011, I graduated from high school and began going to a community college in town, where I stayed for one year to start my basics. During this time, living at home was a nightmare. I was 19 and still had to ask permission to do anything and everything. I was miserable. Meanwhile, my bff and many of my other friends went straight to universities. I was young, impatient, and wanted to be like everyone else, so I transferred to the university in my town that next fall. My dad worked there at the time, so I got a huge discount on tuition as long as I maintained a certain GPA. As I have said, my mother is crazy and strict. Once I was attending, my mother was always in my school business. For some reason, she was under the impression that I had to show her my grades daily. She did not understand that college was not high school; we do not receive report cards, and my grades were just that—MY grades. I felt no obligation to show her or anyone else how I was doing in school. In all honesty, I was doing very poorly. I was not adjusting well to college and it showed in my grades. I was never one to disappoint my parents. I always tried my best in school and made decent grades, so this was all completely new to me. So, when my mom was constantly asking to see my grades and I refused, conflicts arose. 
Living at home was harder than ever. I was trying to grow up and become my own person, while my mother was trying to keep me her baby for as long as she could; except she did it in the only way she knew how, which was to pick fights and push me away. We fought constantly about everything. She tried to take away my phone at times, but I paid for my phone bill so I refused. She went ballistic. Refusing to show her my grades set her off. She even wanted to know my login information, which I did not give to her and she hated it. I could not talk to my dad about any of this, because he always sided with my mom, or would just defend her. He never saw her in the same light as my siblings and I did--fearful, crazy, unstable, and unpredictable.
I was 20 by now, and finishing up my first semester at college. My grades were the worst I’ve ever had, and I knew my mom would be upset. Bff and I had been planning to move out together soon, except neither of us told our parents. I knew the conversation with my mom would not be civil, and bff's mom would just try to talk her out of it. My mom has a history of getting violent, both verbally, mentally, and physically. This is one of the reasons I tried to never disappoint or anger her. She never laid a finger on me (aside from spankings when I was younger), and in my mind I would never let her. I would never put up with abuse as she did to both my siblings. I had seen first hand what she was capable of, and that scared me. So, I came up with the best solution I could think of to protect myself. 
It was now the end of the semester, and grades were posted. I was ashamed of how terrible I did and I knew my mom would want to see them when she got home. So, I packed a bag and I told my dad I was going out, and left. Before getting even a mile down the road my mom called me. She knew something was up—call it mother's intuition. I told her that I was leaving, that I could not do it anymore, and that I was sorry. She completely lost her mind, which I expected. In my mind I had two options; stay and tell her in person and risk getting hit (the risk was a 100% possibility), or do as I did. Eventually I got to my destination, a friend’s house, and I explained everything. I called my sister and told her everything, and unfortunately put her in the middle of it all. My mom was desperate to get me to come home, so eventually I agreed to meet her at my friends house. Before my friend got a chance to tell her mom our plan of moving out, my mom beat her to it and told her everything. This complicated everything more. We met at her house, and I was terrified of seeing my mom. I knew what was coming. Sure enough, when I denied going back home, she tried to hit me and shoved me into a bookshelf. I threatened to call the cops, and friends mom asked her to leave. In return she took my car and left me there. Everyone was in shock; there were no words to describe how we each felt. I eventually called my sister and she came to pick me up and took me home with her. That night was one of the longest of my life. I broke my parent’s heart, and they broke mine. That one decision, forever changed my life. 
My friend and I were still in touch to move in together, however it was not for a month or so. For the next few months, I was considered homeless. I stayed with my sister, a friend I met at college, and a coworker from when I worked at Walmart. During all this time I only had the bag of stuff I took with me the night I left home. My mom refused to let me get my stuff, and in all honesty, I was terrified to go back and get it. During this time, I met my boyfriend. We were coworkers at Walmart, and he invited me to stay with him and his roommates during the holidays, which I accepted. We clicked and decided that when I moved into my apartment with my friend, he would move in too and help with the rent. 
One day, bff and I were finally able to sign for a 6 month lease on a 2 bedroom apartment. The day came when we could finally move in, which my bf and I did. Neither of us had many belongings. He came from the dorms at college, and I came with my bag. I kept asking my friend when she was bringing her stuff, so she would bring little things over, like dishes or other impersonal items. I began getting the feeling that she was hiding something from me. Sure enough, I was right. One day, she texted me and told me how sorry she was, but that she would not be moving in with me and would continue to pay her half of the rent. Not only had I lost my relationship with my parents just months before, but I also lost my best friend. I was so upset at her for doing that to me, betraying me, and not even having the nerve to tell me in person but over a text. At this point the only people I had in my life was my sister, and my bf. My life kind of sucked. 
For the next few years, my mom called me constantly, leaving me ugly voicemails, calling me every name in the book, and completely disowning me. My dad was hardly aware of the situation, and kept his distance; he never even reached out to me. In addition to disowning me, my mom also disowned my sister and her two kids, because she thought my sister helped me plan my moving out. To this day, my mom has never tried to make contact with my sister or her kids. In fact, those kids are terrified of her and hate her because of what she did to my sister and me. my niece, who is know 13 actually has nightmares about my mom. 
About 4-and-a-half years ago, my mom let my dad bring me my stuff. It was a truckload of my belongings, half of which she destroyed. I remember going through it with my sister, we pulled out a blanket that smelled like a combination of vomit and urine. I had to throw it out, as well as other items that were crushed or vandalized. I never got all of my stuff back, and I probably never will. I had never stepped foot in that house again until last year when I went to visit my dad. My mom was not home so I knew it was safe. We talked outside for a bit, and I asked to go inside. I wanted to see my old room. There were still some of my things in the closet and room, like my rock collection. I asked my dad if I could take it with me but he said no, because then my mother would know I was there and he wouldn’t want to upset her. I walked around the rest of the house, everything was the same as the last time I was there; they even still had our pictures up—which I thought was ridiculous. All of my old toys from when I was a child were packed away somewhere. My dad said maybe one day I can have them. I hope one day I can, because it stinks not having one thing from my childhood to see or hold, or give to my future kids. 
It has been about 7 years now since everything happened, and I still cry for the relationship I will never have with my parents. I cry that I will never feel the embrace of my mom or dad again; that I will never hear them tell me “I love you” ever again; that they will never know their future grandchildren or son in law. It hurts me so deeply, but I know that nothing will ever be the same. I truly believe that my mom has an illness, and even if she were to seek out help, I would never be able to talk to her the way I used to again. I envy the people who have amazing parents, who love them unconditionally, the way a parent is supposed to love their child. I question everyday why I was not blessed with parents like that. Every time something bad happens in my life, I question if it is my karma for leaving the way I did and if that is what I deserve for hurting my parents. I cannot begin to imagine the pain and hurt I put my mother and father through, but I don’t think that is an excuse for their behavior or the way they treated my sister and I. I have spent many days and nights crying for that loss, and I hope that one day I can truly move past this, and be happy the way I once was knew how to be. ",1

I've never accomplished a SINGLE thing in my entire life. This depression has gone on for 7 years now.

dev_pid_2059,"It's so hard to ""reach out"" : I've been on and off severely depressed since the fall. I work really hard to manage it and am seeing a new therapist this coming week but the ""working hard to manage"" part is so exhausting sometimes or maybe all the time idk. 
I know isolating myself is not healthy to the point of it being dangerous but it's just so hard to deal with other people. People I'm not open about my situation with are exhausting and/or irritating to be around. I get so drained by just an hr or two of socializing and a lot of things I would normally love are just out of the question. (which makes me sad about being depressed) 
I'm also having a hard time with the people that do know what's going on to some extent. I hate dealing with their reactions, even the kind ones. People ask what they can do to help and I just don't have anything to tell them. I wish I did because I know they want to help. I keep canceling and not following up on tentative plans because I just sit around and cry. I dont want anyone to see me like that. Or im anxious and can't properly make decisions about anything. I think an unanswered text means someone hates me etc and then I'm so out of sorts I can't handle hanging out when they do answer.
I've been friends with people who get severely depressed and while l love and care for them i know first hand how hard it can be to be around them. I feel so guilty that I am now that person to others. I don't want to harm people with how unhappy i am but I'm afraid i am which makes me isolate more and I see how this is a negative reinforcing loop. 
So how do you deal with other people? Do you have things you ask them to do for you because it will at least make them feel better? How do you respond to, ""is there anything I can do?"" How do you deal with not wanting to be a burden but also not completely isolating yourself?",1

I checked his arms and legs when he wasnt looking. I talked to him atleast once a week. Fuck i saw him earlier yesterday, and i couldnt fucking tell.

I gave myself some alone time and tried to figure things out and went back to normal in around a month. I actually don't look at the lows that we have in life in a negative way, I look at them as an opportunity to learn, to be stronger when I face the same problem again. My friends say I'm a very negative person which I think is probably true and thats what I wanted to discuss here. 
Even when I feel alright, when I feel happy one thought in my mind never changes and that is - ""life is pointless"".

It’s always there a little, but this whole winter has been REALLY hard. It’s difficult to separate what’s wrong with me and what’s wrong with my marriage lately though. 
Anyway, I started a challenge with my husband to help our marriage a bit. It was supposed to be fun, help us to reconnect, be more open emotionally, etc. The last two days it was like he wasn’t even trying. He never got excited about it. 
It was super triggering for some reason. I felt alone, rejected, unimportant, and like I can’t trust him to do what he says he will. 
I completely lost it. Screaming, yelling, crying, punching walls, throwing things. During my first bout of depression I remember doing that a few times but I think it was because I mixed alcohol and antidepressants. I’m not on anything this time. Maybe I need to be.

dev_pid_2070,"Do I have depression? What should I do? : [18F] I’ve been feeling very restless since i was 16, which gradually got worse in the last 2 years. I know that I enjoy studying and I do have many other goals I want to achieve (such as exercising regularly), but I can’t seem to translate them into actions. 
I suspect it started due to a burn out. When I was 13-15, I did well in my exams and it felt good so I really enjoyed studying. Hence, all I did was to study all day. Approaching a major exam, I think I started to burn out and I sometimes just laid on my bed and used my phone when I should have been studying.
This went out of control when I entered high school. There was a steep learning curve, and everyone around me were smarter than me. Studying became less enjoyable, and my tendencies to stay in bed all day doing nothing became stronger than ever. Looking back, those were really hard times, my mind was literally telling me to study but my body wouldn’t budge an inch. 
I thought that it would be over after I have finished my exams, but unfortunately not. At first, I tried very hard to get out of this situation. I worked hard to find a job during my break, and started journaling. However, such progress was only short-lived. Even though I managed to get a temporary job, everyday when I reached home and on weekends, I was one with my bed. Now that I’ve received my results, I’m even procrastinating with my uni applications. 
My parents were very strict and controlled my life for the first 13 years, so i don’t think i was given the chance to develop my self-discipline. 
I’m not sure if I have issues with my self-discipline or if i have any mental illnesses. I have many goals for myself, which I have written and typed so many times in an attempt to kick start my momentum, but they never materialise. I am normal at work (except maybe a little lack of self-confidence), but off work I literally do nothing useful. 
Can someone help me analyse my situation and also provide tips on how I should proceed from here? I would really appreciate any help, thank you!",1

dev_pid_2073,"8 sessions into Neurofeedback. Should I be seeing improvement? : I’ve had the brain mapping done and my therapist thinks it’s not so bad. I’m a logical, generally happy person but I’m crippled with depression and emotional dysregulation. 
—-context—-
I was an artist until the stress of a very toxic job and unstable relationship kind of killed my self esteem and identity as an artist. All of my dreams to be a business owner, real estate owner, and artist seem out of my reach as a poor person without stability or a safety net and realizing this leaves me with no motivation and actual dread every day. I’ve been trying to meditate on what to do: build up my floral business that people keep encouraging me to do (but I can’t even afford flowers), paint the paintings I feel disenchanted with that others love, return to a career (if I can get a job) that supports me but is ageist and sexist and soul crushing? I can’t find an answer and I feel trapped in limbo and paralysis. If money/rent wasn’t an issue things would be a lot different. I make plans as often as possible with friends but outside of that I can barely get myself out of bed. Even my bed isn’t stable as I can’t afford my rent. I’m working freelance for my bf and he’s and paying for NF so I have this rare opportunity to turn it around.
—-/context—-
So far nothing though. I have trouble staying awake during the sessions like my brain is broken and I just lose consciousness or go into a haze. I don’t feel any reward for modulating my brainwaves. I don’t even feel like I can control them. The “games” don’t interest me and trying to keep the bad feedback (racecar slowing down, screen fading) from happening just frustrates me. I can barely keep my eyes open during any of it. Outside, I’m still feeling maximum anxiety and depression. 
Am I doing this wrong? What’s happening?",1
dev_pid_2074,"Everytime you feel like you've found out the cure, you soon realise you have just scratched the surface. : I think depression is something deeper than just feeling down. I am 22 and had a real bad bout of depression when I was 18 and 19. Things have been good since then as I learnt a lot and made things easier for myself. The past few weeks have been great. I finally have a picture of what I want in life. I recently got accepted into a grad school and things in general have been going well but today something just hit me. 
A familiar feeling. My old acquaintance. Ah we meet again. Why, it's been so long, how nice of you to visit today. But I didn't invite you. Oh? You just barged in. Well, guess I have to make room for you today.
It's almost like I forgot what it really feels like. The way it consumes you. All of you. You become helpless; thoughtless; beingless. The lump in your throat. The gravity in your stomach. It's such a unique feeling but I did forget about it, at least for a while. 
Once it hit me, I couldn't help but reminisce about my past. The nostalgia is almost poetic. Most of me hates this feeling but there's a part of me that absolutely craves it. This is why I'm lead to believe that depression is not something you can completely erase. Even if you're okay for a few years, it might creep up on you inadvertently.
I guess what I'm saying is to not think of it as something you wish you didn't have but rather focus on how you can make the most of yourself despite these awful feelings and hope that they go away for a while. I hope that reading this might give you a perspective and help you live the life you deserve.
Thanks for reading. I'm out!",1
dev_pid_2075,"unrequited : all my life, my feelings have been unrequited... and im crying without feeling anything anymore. does this mean im already numb? but stil i am crying.
i should have known. my roommate, who i have strong feelings for, was desperate to have his car cleaned last Saturday. and when i got off from his car, he wiped it after me, the windows and the footstep. i didnt even place my foot there.
this Sunday, i thought he was sleeping late or not feeling well even. it turns out that he left early. so he has a date. he even bought a hair gel at the supernarket yesterday. so it was a date. his car was not at the parking spot. i feel so foolish and stupid. he even knodded when i said we can reheat the food for lunch. he could have told me. why keep it a secret that your going somewhere. i even cooked for lunch. he may have picked her up and thet went to church together. because he wouldnt have his car washed like that without expecting a girl. this would be a second date. he went to church without me. im alone  now. i wont be able to church now, because he already has a new churchmate. God knows i dont have the money to commute. i guess i will no longer have days at the mall either. he has a new date to the mall now. i really hope this doesnt work out. ive know him and he has disrespected me in every way that i know. i was only treated as someone he needs to live with out of necessity. im not even treated as a good friend. he knows my depression and that may have been a mistake. when i get panic attacks he would also meet me head on and say its an ugly trait. that is not a friend. my therapist called him evil, manipulative, selfish, and childish. i shouldnt have these feelings but what do i do? they say depressed people can still love, but that is just wrong. nobody really cares anyway. whoever that girl is, she is stupid to even consider him. he is still married. separated but still married. and yet there is a girl who still go out with him. talk about being desperate. well i am one of those desperates. i just hate this so much. to be set aside like that. to be not seen. i miss people who treat me better, who treat me as a person. past 2 am and im still crying. im crying because i know ill forever be alone. i dont have anyone. im ugly, unloved, and used for. conveniences.",1

 I still wake up not wanting to be alive or so depressed I wish I could just not exist. I have a lot of trauma from childhood and my past that I cant seem to move past. I lived in an aprtment that got engulfed in flames with my family insided which forced us to go down a fire ladder from the balcony. I watched my dad get beat to a pulp with a 2x4 at 6 years old because he owed the wrong people money. I was taken advantage of by a teenage girl who thought it was fun to make my brother and I strip butt ass naked for her and my fathers friend had a son. another highschool aged kid,  that decided to ""teach"" my brother and I how we were ""suppossed to touch eachother"". I spent time as a homeless youth, spent some time in foster care seperated from my siblings where on my first day at my first foster home the dog accidentally hubg itself because it was leashed up too close to a stair case and slippe. In college I came home to my mom strung out on the floor of a trailer on Christmas after searching for her for days (and this wasnt even the first Christmas this happened). Ive watched both my parents, the people I love the most get arressted. I was 6 years old in the middle of a police raid where my dad and his friends were busted after trying to hide and stow away. His friend blamed me for telling the police his hiding spot. The list goes on and on. Abd today my mom is my best friend to this day and shes also recovering and is 100% happier than she was 5-7 years ago. Most of the negativity in my life stemmed from my father and my mom always tried to right the ship. Memories of seeing her or my now deceased father in the depths of the worst part of their life has left me beat and exhausted. I dont know if im okay because I don't know what okay feels like. 
I normally wear my past as a patch of pride on my sleeve, but my friends of decades have no idea what ive been through other than I was poor and it wasnt easy. I just want to seperate myself from the past and be able to enjoy the life I have now, but I feel like everyone has given me everything they can and said what they can and the last hurdle is on me to clear, but I feel like im lost and confused a lot of the time.
These feelings arent daily, somedays Im completely fine and haopy and I feel like ive beat my depression and aim on top of the world, but when things start coming back  and when they pop back up its rally hard to get out of my head. Thanks for listening I needed to vent. Im exercising (kinda), practicing midfulness,  clean eating, and I take my citalopram daily, but its not always enough.",1

Its like my emotions are manifesting physically. Or maybe its the feeling of seratonin being forcefully withdrawn from my body lol. I just feel pressure on my head and feel nauseous.

I retired from the military, last November. As much as I was looking forward to it, I miss it everyday.  Mainly the comradeship.  The knowing that although the day is stressful, it’s stressful along side your brothers and sisters.  
Moved to a new place, with just my dog.  My kids are adults, but I miss them everyday.

I currently live in PA have a shitty manual labor job i absolutely hate. I graduated with a 1.2 highschool GPA because i can confidently say i never studied or really tried once during highschool. Was literally 30 assignments behind a few weeks before graduation and failing most of my classes so i calculated the exact amount of assignments i needed to do bare minimum to pass in each class and only did the bare minimum but made sure i aced all the ones i did do by using a little bit of effort.
But im 19 now and regretting not caring at all about highschool and not knowing what to do with my life. I dont know what i would like to do as a job maybe something in Law enforcement but im still unclear. Everyone in my family is poor and lives paycheck to paycheck i do NOT want to be like this. I didnt grow up like normal kids so i didn't get to experience things a teenager usually does like going to parties having my first drink or even relationships. I was forced to stay home and care for my great grandmother who had Alzheimers since i was 14-18 taken out of normal school and put in online school so i could be home 24/7 didn't get to leave the house for months at a time except to go and get my haircut every few months. Our hallway was always full of dog poop because i didnt care at the time and they weren't my dogs. Lived with my aunt too but she was a drunk and gambler.

I never really try to make friends with people since it usually just feels like a huge burden on me mentally and emotionally. I have a few friends, which I am grateful for, but I have been thrown down so much.
A few weeks ago however I met what I thought was the perfect girl. I was being very cautious at first and just wanted to be friends since we have a lot in common. We were snapping back and forth and she seemed so interested, things were going so well and I was really feeling good. 
She invited me to come over for a party and to come a few hours before and I did. We chilled a bit and seemed to get along very well. She then started cuddling on me and we ended up spending the night together. 
We kept talking more and hung out again, but she suddenly lost interest out of nowhere. I had let myself get too complacent and she made a burrow in my lonely mind.
She is so perfect to me. She looks amazing, she is interested in all of the same things as me, if anything I envy her a bit because she actually does the things that I was scared to pursue when I was younger out of fear of ridicule.
Now I am just another pathetic loser to her, desperately trying to scrape up our relationship. All I ever think about is how much better life feels with her and how bleak it is without.

Every day this cycle drives me deeper in deeper into this ocean of negative emotions that I can't get out of and I hate myself for it. The only reason, and I mean the only reason, that I haven't offed myself in some field is because it would devastate my family. They are everything to me and yet I'm such a fucking disappointment. They gave me everything and I never had any reason to be sad and yet here I am. I honestly don't know how much longer I can hang on. I'm sorry for the wall of text but I just needed to get this out.

Everyone says ‘depression makes you tired,’ why can’t it make ME tired? Why am I so restless? Why am I up at 3am, lying in bed, thinking of nothing, dreaming of nothing, doing nothing. I want to sleep, and wake up tired, I want to forget about my responsibilities and let my depression move it to the background. Why is my depression scared to be DEPRESSED! 
I’m so tired of NOT being tired! I want to dream of something, no matter how terrible it is, I want my paranoia to rest, I want my paranoia to exhaust me.
I’ve been sick, so I take some liquid meds for cold and flu. Knocks everyone else out — but fucking me. 
I want to sleep, and dream, and I don’t want to be awake all the time time, I don’t want to be awake 5/7 days a fucking week. But it’s like every time I get drowsy — I’m not drowsy, I’m just... dizzy.

Why am I not good enough to do anything. Why do I do the things I do. I love her so much and I do so much but at the same time she has to realize she has stuff to do and can’t be going out and getting all fucked up because we’re depressed. I went through it and I pull myself out of that hole before by myself and I don’t know where to start with her. I tell her not to do things and she goes and does it and I don’t like that about her. I love her so much but we’re both fucked up. I don’t take care of myself all the time because i hate myself so much and she tries to take care of herself but when she drinks or smokes she doesn’t stop and won’t stop until she’s asleep and I worry so much about her and I don’t know what to do about her. I’m not breaking up with her because I love her and I really wanna be with her and help her with what she needs help with but I can’t help her if she doesn’t put the effort in to be able to get better.

I feel less able to cope as well.
I also am finding I'm numb to hearing many of the same suggestions as the first time. I don't know if I even really had depression the first time in hindsight because it was never ever this bad.
Has anyone else had this? Either way, any advice?

I think about grabbing a razor blade and just cutting myself in front of her.

I've lived my life always doing whatever the fuck I didn't want to do because I never had other options, which built up this tower of shit that is now slowly collapsing on me.
I just wanna bash my head in, there more I try the worse it gets, realizing how hard is getting a job even if you have a degree is not motivational at all.
I have no idea how some people can just wake up go to school (consistently) without even knowing what you want out of going to class, basically just raw dogging life. I wouldn't mind working. Life is looking dark in the next few years, probably me having to work at mc dee's until I kill myself, doing something I absolutely despise, I'll be lucky if I can keep myself from killing myself during those times.
I'm ranting out here cause I don't wanna tell anyone, I don't wanna worry anyone around me, it's easier to tell a bunch of faceless strangers on the internet because I don't have to know who knows how I feel. Feels less lonely. I truly hope you guys won't give up like a weakling like me.

I've heard it all...  ""God has a plan for you"", ""Time heals everything"", ""Our struggles make us stronger"", ""There's always someone worse off than you"", etc etc.
So why am I still here? Why bother dragging out the suffering?
Everywhere I look I see fake people, narcissism, delusions of grandeur, masked contempt &amp; hate, jealousy, lies, backstabbers, power-hungry bullies, and criminals - and you know what? They win. Over and over and over and over again I see and encounter individuals who really are despicable in their acts, deeds, and merits, and yet they are winning, happier than me, wealthier than me, with friends and adoring folk around them, even the ones they tread on daily.

I am in a great situation compared to others, I'm not in a warzone, I'm not abused, I have no reason to feel this way. I was 13 when I first had these feelings. Self harm, eating disorder, depression, anxiety - my first suicidal thoughts. I became better, but I spiralled down again. I realise I was never better, but the good days outweighed the bad days.   
I'm now the worst I've ever been. Though I've matured now. Self admitted to therapy, doctors referrals, everything I could do - I've tried. I am not self harming, skipping meals but I'm the worst I've ever been. I should be happy that I'm 18 now, I can drive, go get smashed at the club - yet nothing. The anxiety is through the roof, it feels like I'm drowning. My teenage happy years feel like they have been stolen from me, did I deserve this? Probably not. No-one deserves it. 
I suffer from a couple chronic illnesses, they stop me leaving the house. I am missing a lot of college, I am going to be kicked out soon - I know it. I have been an open book to them. Every doctors note, therapy note they have scanned to their system. But I can't keep going. I don't see a future for me. I wonder what my future will be like, but I can only see now. Tonight isn't the night I'm leaving my past behind - but I know soon I'll bite the bullet. 
I just wish there was more support for men. I haven't tried any medications for this illness, the doctors have rejected it. I think that was my last chance of hope.

I felt so shit and I didn’t care. That’s untill my mum came home aboht 15 minutes later. That’s when I broke down and lost it and just cried and cried and cried for a day straight. The 2nd time I had just left school and I went and sat on top of a multi story car park for hours on end until it got dark.

Recently I’ve been feeling the same way I did those two occasions, but the difference is I really really really don’t want to put my family through it all again. My entire family broke down and all they were worried about is me. It’s only just gotten to the point where if the phone rings my mum doesn’t automatically assume I’ve been found dead or something. I really don’t want to put them through any of that again, but I know that if it wouldn’t efffect them, then I wouldn’t think twice. I don’t know what I should do from here.

2020 came by and my two other friends decided to ditch me. We dont hang out anymore and they dont even contact me unless I contact them first.      Whatever. I still have K, right? We have a weird relationship. She knows that she can give me minimal attention and I'd stick around, but we hang out basically every day. 
She's using me. I know she is. But fuck, I just enjoy being in someone's company.

My counselor keeps saying that I should talk to people and people genuinely don’t mind, but I really can’t wrap my head around it. Why would anyone want to listen to my bullshit problems? Why do I matter? I live in a first-world country and have so many opportunities. I can’t complain about anything.

I want to enjoy all the things I used to love, but I just can’t. I keep trying and trying but it just keeps getting worse. I just feel so hopeless and like a useless piece of shit. I keep comparing myself to others and I know I shouldn’t but I just keep doing it.
I feel like such a useless sack of shit and I don’t deserve anything. I would love to have a partner but I don’t think anyone would want to deal with how I am.

I would wear stupid fake eyelashes or curl my eyelashes if i had to go out and go to the delivery person who goes to my dorm.

I started banging my head on walls to the point where I would pass out. I started cutting at 9. I’ve tried suicide 3 times that I remember. After overdose attempts I barely remember the next few weeks. I’ve gotten so good at faking that anytime I break everyone says “but you’re always so happy! You can’t be depressed.” I don’t even know what I feel anymore. I can’t tell what emotions I feel except for depression and anxiety. I think about suicide every day and I just want it all to end.",1
dev_pid_2138,"Disastrous life, need help :  I am a 19 year old from a Third world Country, I have been increasingly depressed with how my life is and with every breath i take I feel its too much for me to bear so i'm here!
So thing starts in grade 6 when my ambitious mom decides to get me admitted to a very posh School where only the richest kids go and mind you my family was no where near rich and were only able afford my education through cutting all our spending in other places. So the first year in that school goes HORRIBLY wrong with me having trouble to adjust with other kids as most would just make conversation about the things i can only hope to have in my dreams so i mostly kept quiet and everybody started picking on me and bullying me to the point that anyone who even talked with me was labelled as a ""uncool"" person and other people would avoid that person. 3 years went like this where every minute in school felt like a nightmare and my only happiness came from playing games on a half busted computer. Grade 9 came, I got switched to a different section and got a new bunch of people that didn't know me, so i started lying about everything and made some brand new friends and also fell in love with a girl but guess what she made me her best friend but rejected me as a boyfriend clearly indicating affection for ripped dudes with muscles, While i was here who cant even afford to get a gym membership(I'm Skinny AF). I give my O levels(Grade 10 exams) and did moderately well and guess what i didn't even get a ""good job"" from my dad. Then suddenly my parents tell me i cant go to school anymore as they cant afford it so i only get private tuition by teachers who do not belong to any school. In the mean time my family goes broke to the point that we can no longer afford the moderately sized apartment and have to move to a LITERAL CAVE, this house has 2 rooms only which is Cluttered with furniture and NO LIGHT comes here, this alone made me consider suicide, now My A level exams are 2 months away and I'm heavily under prepared as all i do is nothing and listen to sad songs. Mind you i literally skipped my Family problems, tldr my father doesn't live with me as he does his work in a different state and my mother hates him and he in turn hates her, my Sisters life is , to say the least destroyed and that has caused her to do all sorts of crazy things, like she for 4 months straight thought my parents were conspiring to \*\*\*\* her! amidst these things here i am with a Crazy Inferiority Complex to the extent that makes me feel down at everything i do in life. Now the Few friends i have are all going to better places to study and now i have no one left in my life, no friends, Intense loneliness. My love for money is the same as a homeless person, Money would have solved all my problems so everywhere i go i can only think of becoming a rich af, it hurts that all the people i used to hang out with have so much money from their parents and i start out with no money at all. I am willing to work 24/7 to become some billionaire but the thought that it might not work at all and i might stay the same old poor me with no life no friends no money no wife, this feeling of anti-hope makes me want to hang myself. I have tried committing suicide once before and got caught while putting my head through the noose and the scream of my mother made me not want to do it. Now nothing feels good, nights go by crying the dark alone.
If you belong to the 5% that read through that please respond and say ANYTHING, i want a human to understand my position right now. 
Thanks to all responders in advance :')",1
dev_pid_2139,"struggling hard right now : ive been really struggling to be positive at all lately and it hits me hard whenever i have a bit of quiet time to myself.
over the past few months a lot has changed for me, some good, a lot bad. work is not going so great which is hard for me as it used to be such an important part of my life, now i just feel isolated and filled with dread whenever i am there, like an uneasy feeling i cannot really explain or shake.
i have a feeling like my life is going nowhere and i am not progressing as a human being, like i am not the man i sould be, the fact i am still fairly young (23) doesnt come to mind, i feel like i am running out of time and i havnt got much to show for myself
a few months back i met girl, through a friend during a weekend of mountain biking ( one of the few things i can do right now that helps me forget for a few hours at least) we sort of hit it off and became good friends rather quickly, something rare for me being autistic and having a lot of social problems. obviously i started to catch feelings for her, and after seeking a shite load of advice from close friends and a few failed attempts i finally scrapped together thr courage to tell her how i felt, i got a very thoughful knock back (something i was expecting deep down) and we both said that remaining friends will be completely okay, part of the reason i struggled to share my feelings was the fear of losing a good friend. however i know feel like i am slowly being pushed away. i am really struggling to cope with this lately as i feel like i have yet again ruined something that was going well in my life and i have been really beating myself up about the whole thing, getting the almost relentless feeling of being completely alone  that i am right for nobody.
i also have a very self destructive tendency to convince myself that nobody really cares about me, despite having some very close friends, some that i have actually grown closer to over recent months. friends that can make me feel that they love and care about me when i am with them can turn into people that wouldnt really care about me if i was to dissapear when left alone with my mind.
the only thing i have found that helps with these feelings is tasking myself to do things to keep my mind ocupied, tasks that i have to think about fully when doing them that i cannot think about anything else. i have chopped a hell of a lot of firewood in the past few days. but i cant do that sort of thing 24/7, which is when all those feeling flood back in. relentlessly. without fail.
i dont really know what to do anymore and honestly i am pretty damn scared",1

I struggle to find any kind of solace in anything, and I don't believe any thinking techniques truly work at all. People equate changing behavior to changing thinking, but that isn't the case. I can't stop feeling angry.
I have no outlet because it is 1. Too late to change the past events that I am angry about, and 2. Nothing I do will change anything in the present.
I am sick of being alive, I am sick of always feeling left out, disrespected, alone, and without a sense of community or belonging. I am surrounded by closed minded people who live in echo chambers, and who never believe they do anything wrong. Everything seems to end up being ""my fault"", regardless of my involvement.
My lived experience has been like this for the past 15 years. I thought things would get better when I got older but nothing really did. I am still me, and I am not someone I am proud to be. I wish so much that I had had better company, guidance, support, and quality of mental state.

dev_pid_2144,"My Terrible Life story, im done (im not suicidal) : First off, its my first post ever on Reddit so sorry for the mistakes im going to do, also sorry for the title, i don't wanna annoy anyone but its just how i feel currently...  
And to anyone who has a soft hearth you should better stop reading, im going to talk about some more extreme stuff and idk, i just felt to warn.  
To be honest i am not even sure how to start...
Well im going to write now my story down, im typing this via Tor so i should be not in direct risk of a police investigation.
Im currently 17, going to school have an 2.0 and i just going to tell now my story, i still dont know how to start after thinking for 15mins.  
I got the information from my mother that when i was in the Kindergarden i had no emphatic abilitys, she told me that i walked over kids and so on, i also was in 3 Therapies for some years to gain some of these abilitys and to become atleast normal and dont be stupid, also im sure that i got there my interest for sience. I had Images from that time that ive builded as Example two towers connected by another and i also builded around that time out of lego complex stuff and i liked to help others, also the only other thing i remember was that ive had in a game 4 times a 6. Then i was going to an special school wich started with an 0th class (yep i know it sounds like bs but its not... actually its not lied but its bs) It was a smaller school wich i had an unbeliveable nice teacher, she even allowed us to ride once on her parents horses. Then our class had split up bec we were too less and a while after i was in the new class i switched to an normal school, i cant tell when exactly or why the school got closed some years later since it would give hints instandly to me. in the new school i was in a relation ship with a girl slided her pants down the list time we saw us, i know thesedays its thinking over sexualized but back in the time it was just doctorgames or something like that, also i tell it here since it will be relevant later on. In the new school i had 3 female friends, i often did hurt them at games like hidenseek but didnt understand that i did that, i was still lacking emphaty, they all remember me as an idiot, the teachers said i should think about my actions but i didnt know what thinking was. (also i should mention that it was like ive skipped a class since as example what we would do in the 3th class they do in the 2th, one more information is that i never learned the Abc or this other form of writing.)  
In that time i had doctorgames with another girl but without touching, the next day she talked about everyone about it)  
And while that time i watched sience shows for 2 years, in that time i had my first depression since i started to think and to understood that our lifes are useless, i was also scared of the power of nature. Im not sure if it was here that my mom had a shop in another country with my aunt. i drove like every weekend and holiday for 2 years  there, on the way i first time learned to controll what i see, in your words imanigation, from that point on i done it like extremly often. around that time when i was out i had my first friend outside of the school, we were often in the forest doing shit, with my belgium cousin we played minecraft on a virus flooded laptop from me and yea life was simple for me.  
ITS TIME TO LET THE SHIT GO DOWN
once a battle over money came up and we litterally fleed with an other cousin wich lived at my aunt out of the country, we did hide our car somewhere and he broke multible windows and raced in a 50 zone with 130 and lost after that they his license for a while, we escaped to our home country. then my mom opened her own buisness. meanwhile i came in the 5th grade and had fun batteling with 11th graders in sience and i also learned that my brain is slowly advancing stupidly fast, a teacher gave me a long mathematic x=... and he just gave me one precalculated one, i remember that i didnt know what ( etc means but after 30min watching it i learned to calculate such equaltion , also in my head i could controll my dreams, i builded up a futurist world where everything is fine and the technologys i created over time in my head are real machines wich are innovative.) i didnt make really friends at that time, it didnt bother me. in 6/7th grade i had a social teacher helping me since i saw her as a mother at that time my head started to let me see memories like a video, my brain adapted to an pc analysing like vision, my math grades exploded, also i kept rooms i was in in my head and on the floor when light was off i could overdraw what i see with red lines and also i could manipulate my own memories (wich fucked me since im not sure if anything i tell here isnt a fucking manipulation) in that time i was often in illegal streams too to watch anime, once i got interested and just pressed on a ad with flat boobs, i keep doing that until i came to a page with pornhub at start and a link going my entire screen, it was my first contact with cp. To this day im sure that some people from pornhub host in normal net childporn but just hide it extremly well. Also WTF can a little kid find cp but not some fucking paid police officers.... Then it interested me, i didnt get hard or something, it was just sheer the new wich dragged me to get tor and seach stuff up and i did find it and i watched it a whole year, i wanted to know why people do such things and so on, it just interested me their motives, i know its terrible and im preparing already for the negative karma flood but yea, (watched reddit videos). then i skipped a class again. in my new class my grades exploded in the prositiv and i met a girl, the girl teached me emotions over time, in winter also i had a relation started with a girl wich i played often and we videochatted alot, she was a year younger then me, you need to know that i was fat at that time and some people really though im old, even tho i wasnt even 15... her brother forced us to stop contact. after that i was down and really sad. at that spring my head started to hurt a bit always and slowly i my ability to remember stuff got bad, when i overjumped i knew wich cloth everyone had to any day, i could give exact dialogs some days after so on. at that time i stopped the relation with my best and first real friend i had since he emotionally abused me. my parents splitted also up a year before and my mom moved to another man and left me and my brother together at a home, i was the one who said yes but yea, i also saw all the abuse from my parents aganist each other... even the blood on the floor. but back in the time now i also slept like 2-4 hrs everyday... i also stopped really learning new things ( men while i type this down i stopped and started alot of shit lol) she also teached me how to talk normal and not just in complicated words, funny thing is i can now just talk so and not complicated. i also took an iq test wich revealed that im very close to autism, my brain structure is different and the test were made in 4 catergory's, in one i had 78 point and in the highest i had 138, the docs told me they never seen such an difference, the highest they even knew before was 24. wich is extrem already, over years my grades got worse, my meorie system is fucked now, i can remembler like almost nothing, i cant learn anymore, i had 2 breakdowns, i figured out that my family dont cares about me, my brother emotionally abuses me, i cant learn anymore and i feel degenerating. i lost my vision my dream world wich always protected me, i have now friends and emphaty but the question is what do i do now?  
Im stuck, i want out of this life, i wanna develope the technologys in my head but how when noone belives me, i could have a trauma from the forced end relation from the other shit or from the time where an another aunt used a hammer to attack us with the aunt before to get somehow money, i stopped to belive in god a long time ago, im just lost, i want my memories back my old abilitys, i wanna find a way how to get out of this shit, i know i missed alot of informations but does anyone know what i have to do, i tried to give an text about whats wrong with me but im just not fine anymore. please help me, im lost my memories are gone im degenerating my mental health getting abused my family doesnt care about me. What should i do...  
i know its terrible written, but i just lost the ability to write it better, but its getting every day worse, im at a point where i read text a then b then c and after c i know just c... (1/6th of a page). do i want attacktion, did i lost the hate though emotions i gained over time what is going on, im not even sure if my memories are real. please give me advice, to get some sort of attention i even was on a loli page and we are developing a game so people respect me... wtf is wrong with me",1

All they do is, while telling you something, trying to push you to tell something back so they know something about your family.
 And I just don't understand anymore, all I can see is people laughing with someone and turning around to roll their eyes. So why shouldn't they do that to you too? 
Its the same thing with texting, i can't do it. It feels so fake, every emoji they use and the things they say.

dev_pid_2150,"I'm falling back into depression and I don't know what to do : So I'm in my early 20s, I'm cis female and I'm lesbian. I have severe anxiety but I'm a musician so I interact with a lot of different people. I always try to be nice to people and move on with my life. I'm a private person so I don't ask too much about others and expect the same in return. So basically this dude DMs me and says he likes my music, I thank him for the support and send him an unreleased track (which isn't abnormal for me, I send my music to anyone who will listen). So one day I do a QnA and he asks me, ""How does p!ssy taste?"" This shakes me up kinda because even though I don't hide my sexuality, I keep it to myself and don't go into detail. I tell him to never ask me something like that again and says he understands, I brush it off as a one time occurrence. I decide to start to dry text more than I usually do, avoid, and distance. One day he DMs me again, and is like, ""check my story."" I tell him that there's no way I'm doing that without knowing whats on the story. He tells me he plans on dropping his ex girlfriend's nudes but tells me whats on his story is just a fight, I shut him down immediately and tell him what he wants to do is illegal. I don't click the story and I move on. The last occurrence was after he sent me a meme. I sent him a 100 emoji hoping to end the conversation naturally then out of no where he's like, ""This girl tried to send me titty pics but got mad when I said I didn't care"" Again, I shut him down and was like, ""I don't want to talk about this and I'm not the person to speak to on this."" He says he understands and is like, ""I respect that, I'm just really young so I don't understand things like that."" that freaks me out, like this dude knew I don't discuss sexual things. I just tell him, ""everyone has boundaries"". He described me as ""family-friendly"" to my face. I don't know anything about this person, he did mention something about being three in 2010 when Nicki Minaj was famous but I have no way of verifying that.
So that brings me to recent events, I end up telling him to stop contacting me (I made a public post about leaving me alone that was partially at him and to set firm boundaries) . Out of morbid curiosity I go onto his twitter. I see an Omegle chat where he claims to be 18 but who really knows, I scroll down and I see that he's tweeted out pornhub videos (which is something I don't see very often). I go onto his likes and at first it's just some sports stuff. I decide to scroll down some more and it goes from ""porn out of context"" clips to hentai, some weird hentai too like girl being roughly screwed by humanoid pig creature porn. That's when it clicks why he didn't respect my boundaries, it puts everything else into context as well. So that brings me to where I am right now. I feel conflicted. I feel like this is my fault because I didn't research who this person fully was, granted I shut down certain topics if I felt like they were going in a direction I didn't like. I handled it the best I could. I blocked him shortly after. I feel stupid and weak because I didn't stand up for myself but I just assumed it was going to end up being a one time event and the first time was a simple misunderstanding. I minimized, I'll be real. I know I sound stupid but I feel like a slipped up and let a boundary of mine be disrespected, I had just been trying to not go off on people and be civil but it didn't work. It makes me feel sick but at the same time guilty. My anxiety is telling me I did something illegal unintentionally. I feel somewhat violated by this whole experience but I feel shame because I'm not sure how I should react. I feel weak because I should have stood up for myself.",1

Then saying something like ""if you say you're depressed or want to kill yourself, you're just antention seeking. If you actually wanted to kill yourself, you would just do it.

It’s crazy how a family can change how you live and your general outlook on life.
       Anyway, my thoughts are all over the place and it’s difficult to even stay on one subject for me nowadays. What I’m saying is, I’m depressed and that’s okay. What’s not okay is me not doing anything about it. But it’s just not that easy, I tell myself and everyone I give advice too that it is. And show the resources available but I just can’t shake it. It doesn’t go away ever, ever since I was a just a young lad. Even when I first started talking to my now wonderful girlfriend back in freshman year of high school. Even last week when I was laughing at a “dad joke” a co-worker made. It’s such a scary thing to accept I might succumb to it. Like how cancer takes people everyday, so does depression. But I just can’t get help. I know how, and could find a way to afford it. Just can’t, don’t know why I’m making this post. Maybe to find like minded people, maybe to find the help. Maybe to feel better for saying even just a bit for a few minutes. Maybe because I won’t wake up when I finally doze off. I just don’t know anymore.

I don’t talk to my friends, when they try to tell me something, I just answer them short, because I don’t want to see them, I don’t want to talk to them. They were once my best friends, now I hate them. I hate everyone. My mother lives far away because of her job. I haven’t called her in months and haven’t answered her calls. I am down to 49 kilos. I never have breakfast. I don’t eat lunch at school, sometimes I don’t even eat dinner. I don’t study or do homework. My grades are going just above the passing grade. I ask myself why, why do I hate everyone and everything, why do I hate my friends who tries to talk to me, why do I hate my parents who always supported me and never stopped loving me. Why do I hate my brother who always helped with every problem I hade. just why.",1

dev_pid_2160,"I feel like I’m decaying : I’m not sure if this is necessary, but most of the wording I feel sounds similar to an ED, so I guess I just wanted to put that as a disclaimer in case that could be a trigger to anyone. 
My brain used to be the only thing I worried about, but now my weight has dropped a significant amount (due to never having an appetite anymore) and it’s scaring me more than ever because something I used to brush off as me “faking it” is now seen physically, making me more aware of the state I’m in. 
I’ve put off getting help since I was 15. Now I’m 22, and I feel like all my emotional problems follow me to the mirror. Or when I’m having a good day, a friend will make a comment or a joke about my weight, and I know it comes from a place of concern (as I have also been told) but it’s just a slap in the face reminder that I’m not okay and I still need help. 
I feel like now my friends are watching me crumble because my outside now matches the inside, and it makes me uncomfortable. I don’t like the worry or pity. I know I have to seek help, yet I can’t stop putting it off because I’m just too afraid. 
I’m basically watching myself get worse and worse but not doing anything about it. It’s frightening because part of me doesn’t even care. I panic because I hate looking so small. But sometimes when I know I should eat more to start to actually get myself back on track, I wonder “why bother?” On my lowest days it’s almost like I want to watch myself decay as some form of punishment. (Which sounds terrible and I feel gross and embarrassed even writing that.) 
I’m hoping more than anything that I can find the motivation to finally talk to a professional tomorrow.",1
dev_pid_2161,"My relationship is collapsing. : And I can only cry about it because it’s all going down because of my depression. 
When we started dating, my partner said we would work on this together. I’ve been there during all the tough times for my partner and I helped and stood strong for us. 
But when the time came for my partner to do so for me... Apparently it’s too hard. So here I am, drowning, realizing that I will lose everything we built for the past two years because my depression is too much to handdle. 
I know it’s over and there is no turning back. I just can’t accept it.

dev_pid_2162,"It (rarely) gets better (without help) : Today I woke up, and my fist though wasn't suicide or self harm. I am still getting used to that. I have been through countless prescriptions, alternatives and therapists, and it never made a difference, I was born broken. Tagged with major depression at age 6, on a watch list for over 25 years after that and since 3 weeks ago I finally feel free.
Who knew a handful of pill could do that to me? I have never been without depression, and I feel stable. I am still me, dark jokes, preparing for the worst, a little slutty, witty, boisterously obnoxious laugh, cat crazy, kind and prone to walls of text.
Side effects? Totally manageable, nothing major.
I went through over 20 different prescriptions and wrote everything in my notepad, but sadly my notes would benefit no one but me, as my brain is unique, and so is yours. Keep writing and talking to those who are supposed to help. Change doctors if you feel they aren't doing their jobs, hell, I went through 3 psychiatrists until my latest found out I suffer from paradoxical reactions to certain neurotransmitters, and the only test for that was to feed me a bunch of pills and then ask for my notes on them.
He got the right prescription, and I am finally me. Applied for a job last night, about to take a shower today, out of my own volition. I am not perfect yet. Still anxious, scared and stuff but for the first time in my life, hopeful.
I will not be telling anyone what my prescription is because it probably won't work for you as it did for me. But there is hope. I am fucking crying while writing this, please don't give up. If you can't do it any more, I can't tell you to hold on and keep going, but I can tell you that medicine keep advancing, and that they found something for me.
It will most likely get better with the right help, therapy and pills. I am finally on the other side, and it feels fantastic. Please join me, and live.",1

Sharing what I’m going through and what I’m feeling is hard enough but when that happens then I don’t want share anymore even after their further prompting. It hurts. It forces me to bury what I feel deep inside. 
People say they listen but they don’t. They ask for me to reword it when I’m saying exactly what I’m feeling. They tell me that what I’m feeling isn’t really what I said but how do they know? How can you tell me what I’m feeling if you’re you and I’m me? That’s not how it works. It just makes me feel more like an alien and a freak.",1
dev_pid_2164,"My path in life is a dead end. : (It turned into a rant and sorry for bad grammar)
My (m27) life feels empty and it feels like my life have stopped and I don’t know where to go from here.
Like I don’t even know if I have a right to complain seeing the struggles of other people on here. I haven’t really accomplished very much in life but I a steady job a car and recently gotten a house but it all just feels.. useless.
Since I was a little kid I dreamed of the day I would grow up and be in a relationship with someone. When I was 16-18 pretty much all of my friend either had been is or was in a relationship but i was the nerdy friend so I felt left behind.
When I was 19 I had my first relationship and that was just a disaster, nothing I did was good enough, her family pretty much hated me (her mother even tried to set her up with someone else). While I might not be the greatest person in the world I don’t think iam that bad. 
Then like a year or so after I broke up with her I got into a relationship with another girl that was pretty much a prefect. It was great, we pretty much never had any fights and life was just really good even though we were just living in a small 1 room apartment and I would trade everything I have now to go back to that. If it is too good to be true it usually is. After she told me she had been messing with another guy at a party I just shut down, I didn’t react in anger or anything but was just speechless. 
I tried to keep the relationship going but couldn’t shake that off. After I broke up with her I pretty much stopped going out and got my current job and haven’t really done anything except working and playing video games. I bought a van so I could turn it in to a party bus so maybe I would want to go out partying but nope, just moved into a house when I ask myself for a reason why I got the house it just boils down to me wanting to be attractive to girls.
Me having a house, a car, a good job won’t help me getting a relationship since it’s my personality that’s holding me back. Iam not a good looking guy and don’t have the personality to back that up, I have tried online dating but have only gotten one match and that didn’t work out at all. 
If we look at life like waking along a path then I have turned up to a dead end with nowhere to go.

So yea when my cousin said we were going to the mall I was really happy because I have little happiness in life rn.

So I ended up getting sick and it didn't go over too well. Ryan also said ages ago that we'd go to a big real arcade because we have this local arcade which doesn't have much but it's still fun. But I told him I don't think it was gonna happen because nothing good ever happens to me. nothing ever gets don't because I have such a shitty family. Well I'm paraphrasing but you get the idea.

All I wanted was to have friends, good friends that will lift me up and be there when I need help. For us guys it’s so hard cos society tells you to “man up” cos men don’t have emotions.

And I was kinda normal feeling for a bit, after years upon of years of feeling like shit. I would say I felt decent for about 2 weeks.

Life just seems like it has nothing left to give, that I've seen as much as I'm ever really going to get to. If I want to see or do the great things you see other people do then you need to make and make it and make money but I'm never going to get to that point. I'm constantly thinking about how life was when I was back in secondary school and when I was younger: Having more friends, having such excitement for the world and what I'll get to see and experience, being able to just have fun, having a functioning family and so many other things. Everyone always said to wait until you get out into the real world, where you can do what you want and experience whatever you want....welp, here I am and it's shit. It's fucking grey, it's fucking dull and it's boring. My eyes don't show a lot of happiness anymore. I wouldn't necessarily say I'm suicidal in the literal sense, I haven't really thought about killing myself but I have a lot of suicidal ideation I guess? When I'm walking across a road I just wish a car would hit me and it'd all be over or some crazed man will just come and stab me nice and easy like. I'm not scared about the experiences I wouldn't get to have or the people I'd leave behind...just the pain of going through with it.

Then they start to ghost you because you’re the damaged and weird kid and they’d rather not deal that. This has happened so many times that unless I really have to I don’t tell them about my past, yet since this is a small town everybody finds out easily, especially the younger people around my age.

I can’t stand the idea of having to work either. I don’t have the motivation to do that nearly everyday for the rest of my life. Sometimes getting out of bed is difficult, so there’s no way I can work until retirement (I’m only 18). 
I don’t want to kill myself and leave my family and cat, they love me so much, but I just can’t see myself living this way for 50+ years. I just feel hopeless all the time that I’m always gonna feel this way. I’ve felt this way ever since I was a little kid. It just gets worse with age.

dev_pid_2203,"Haven't Felt Like Myself in a While : Hi everyone. Since starting my masters I've been miserable/dissatisfied with my life. Although I did well in terms of grades and references I was a reject because my name was ethic sounding/not upper middle class (FYI I'm regular to lower middle class) and commuted to school. Also, I was a male while most of my peers were catty women. 
Moreover, I was a social reject in most of undergrad (except for my last year) and I don't feel too prepared for professional world. I hated working retail and I really don't want to work in it or sales again (at least not for more than 6 months for retail). Ideally I'd like to work for the civil service but I'm not confident in my ability to get hired. I've considered therapy (in fact I might be able to see a psychiatrist through a connection who would put me at the front of the line (public healthcare limits)) but my problems/sadness/recurring mental breakdowns seem to be more connected to where I'm at in life. It's getting really tough to function and I graduated with my masters in November (classes finished in September). I can't finish a lot of tasks I set out to do and I hate who I am as a person. I haven't felt too upbeat about life since high school and even when I like my life at points I just come crashing down mentally.
I tried booking an appointment with my GP but although he was sympathetic and pleasant he seemed to think my symptoms were mild depression and suggested I see the social worker in his office. I know social workers have some training but he didn't even mention how to book an appointment and never mentioned how to see a psychiatrist or psychologist or offered to give a referral. I'd prefer to just ask another doctor for a referral but I live in a country with crap public healthcare so it's tough to find another doctor and I don't know if a new would be any good. It took me weeks to build up the courage to book that appointment and it did little for me. It didn't help that I was doing well when I came in so I didn't describe the worst of my symptoms. Doesn't help that he didn't ask enough about it though.
Also, If i wanted a referral to a specific psychiatrist how easy is that to get?? Could I just book an appointment saying I wanted it or how would that work? 
If I wanted an Aderrall or Ritalin prescription how could I get that? I was hoping to get one the last time I visited my GP specifically about having difficulty focusing and he just said it was probably mild depression. I procrastinated all the time during my degrees but I didn't mention it and I REALLY need something to push me through and help me focus in life.",1

dev_pid_2213,"The dissonance between what I know I can achieve and what I suspect is what makes me happy is extreme and debilitating : My apologies if this comes off as self-aggrandizing at times (and frankly I might have some comment history that would support that interpretation), I don't mean to spew egotistical nonsense, but I feel it's fair to say that I've had more success than most my age.
I KNOW I can achieve great things; I have more than demonstrated that to myself, and seemingly everyone around me believes it and is willing to help me however I ask. I'm an Eagle Scout with 3 palms, I have a Second Dan Black Belt in Taekwondo, I have a full ride merit based scholarship to my university, I'm a second author on a published scientific paper and should be getting a second one soon, I have reason to believe that I might be receiving a prestigious national scholarship for research, and I am a project leader for a really cool project for a campus club. All of this while maintaining a nearly 3.9 GPA in both high school and college.
I've been doing a lot of reflection lately (as one might do when suffering from undiagnosed moderate, borderline severe clinical depression), and am beginning to wonder if at least one source of my depression is all the extra stuff I do beyond school. Right now my depression is soul crushing, to the point that I hate the research I used to love, and can hardly self motivate myself to even play my favorite videogames (let alone do things like be an effective leader for my club, or apply for a nationally competitive scholarship... yet somehow I'm doing both). When I should be working on extracurriculars in my free time, or could otherwise just be playing videogames, I'm lying in bed doing basically nothing because literally nothing sounds like a good time. I constantly feel like I'm failing everything, especially at work, and tbh I think I'm justified in feeling that way because I am fairly regularly dropping the ball at work and have come close elsewhere.
It didn't use to be this way. My freshman and first half of sophomore year were the best times of my life. I had a ton of fun chilling with friends, played some great videogames, got a 3.8 GPA in classes (yes, my GPA has gone UP during my depression), and began doing some really cool research with a nearby hospital. But beyond that, I wasn't doing anything. No college clubs, no scholarship/award/job applications, no extracurriculars. Just getting home from classes and playing videogames in a room with 3 of my closest friends from highschool who were then my dorm roommates (our friendships all survived living together). 
Then I think back to highschool, and although I would have never admitted it back then, I was nearly as depressed as I am now. This was back when I was earning Eagle Scout and becoming a TKD instructor, in addition to excelling in high school AP classes.
Although I'm not yet sure it's a direct causal relationship (and I know there are other factors to my depression, such as my relationship history (or rather lack thereof)), it sure is concerning looking back and realizing that the severity of my depression appears to directly correlate with my involvement in extracurricular activities of any kind. The dissonance between what I can achieve and what appears to make me happy is frightening to say the least.
Note: I am seeking treatment from my university's psychiatric office; but, I believe I am only 8ish weeks into a 12 week wait-list.",1
dev_pid_2214,"How much is too much to ask? : So this is my second time at the depression rodeo and I'm crashing pretty bad, but I don't know how much help to ask for. I don't have a therapist at the moment - I'm working on it, on a waiting list but now medicated and taking steps to get out of the house and all that - but I need support and I want to ask my friends for some. 
Friends aren't therapists, and I know this. Frankly, I'm terrified of treating my friends as therapists so I have a tendency to bottle things up until, surprise surprise, I am a mess and need to ask for help. I can, for the most part, function on my own. I get up, get dressed, drink my coffee, drive to school, etc on my own, but sometimes I just need someone to *be there*. Not talking to me or having to give me physical contact or anything, just kind of exist in my vicinity. 
Thing is, I know how odd it is to just ask someone to sit with you without making conversation, even if you're at a coffee shop or another chill kind of place. To be honest, I don't have the energy to talk to others at the moment, but I'm definitely an extrovert and I've learned I need the company of others to feel just a bit better, even if it's just for a short time. I want to be invited along to places and to hang out with others - I just don't want to be a soggy bag of beans that people take places because they feel obligated to, especially since the majority of my ""people time"" is spent vacantly staring into space trying to bring myself back into my body from disassociation. A lot of the time, I know it looks like I'm in pain because I have a horrendous poker face, but I genuinely do enjoy being out with others, though I'm well aware it doesn't look like I do most of the time. 
Do you think it's too much to ask my friends to just sit with me, doing homework or drinking coffee/tea/beverage-of-choice? If it's not, how do I ask friends for help without turning them into therapists? I don't want someone to listen to my sadness rants, I just want some company.

I was beaten and my dad at the time I think he sexually abused me. 
I was adopted. 
I was hell to raise. No one understood why such small things would send me on a rampage. I feel so bad to anyone who was my friend. I was possessive. I was so toxic. I just didnt want to be lonely. I'm sorry.

dev_pid_2220,"I'm 30 in less than a month and hate myself : Woo boy this is a long fucking read strap in.
I've dealt with depression my whole life. I was bullied quite literally every day from the start of kindergarten til I graduated. It made me fearful of people's intentions and paranoid someone is out to get me. The worst culprits were the drug dealer my age who put a hit out on me in 8th grade, the guy my age that beat the shit out of me just so he wouldn't have to go to art class in grade 10, and the 3 girls (2 exes and a scorned girl who I almost dated before this) that tried to have me charged with false rape claims (failed after 2 months of investigation and the scorned girl coming clean to the police of the whole plot) so they wouldn't have to see me at school in my grade 11 year.
This manifested in me removing people from my life over minor things to protect myself, constantly deleting social media accounts to start fresh at any sign of compromise, and distancing myself from people for fear of them using my secrets against me.
I made it through high school though. Yay! Except a year later my brother hung himself. It broke me. I still break down in secret every few weeks. No one knows. Not even my girlfriend. I don't tell anyone anymore because it's been 11 years and I should be 'over it'. 
I've had 6 brain injuries over 6 years in the middle of my 20s that have taken most of my memories of my ""best years"", a hernia surgery described to me by the surgeon as the worst case hes ever seen in someone my age, and the anxiety and trauma of everything has fucked me up.
I've been diagnosed with minor agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, massive depressive disorder, and now I'm being tested for autism. I haven't been able to hold a job for longer than a couple months in years because of all of this. I started school last summer, did a term, got kicked out for a term for health reasons, and now I'm back in it but scared I'll end up fucking up again.
I'm 30 next month. I have a loving girlfriend of 4 years who has been with me through some really dark times. I have parents that would give me the world if they could. I have friends that truly care about me. I'm not homeless or dying.... so why do I feel so alone?
I hate myself. I hate everything I've done. I cant look at myself in the mirror anymore and I wonder how anyone can love me. 
I really needed to get this all off my chest. If you read it all, thanks and sorry for taking your time to just bitch about myself.",1
dev_pid_2221,"I feel so lost right now.. : A couple of months ago, I got evicted from my apartment. It wasn't really my fault, I had to deal with family medical issues. A friend of mine was going to be my roommate and gave me money for rent. We put everything in storage and I put everything I had on a down payment for a rent to own house. The financier tells me I need 5x the rent. So I stay with another friend and think that I'll be able to do a partial payment instead of all of February. I call the guy today and he started the clock from the day I put money down. So he wants $2000 tomorrow or no deal. I have half of that. I have no one to borrow from. I'm ready to just end it.",1
dev_pid_2222,"Never did I think this would happen. : The past two years I have been in the best headspace I have ever been in regards to my mental health overall... I got a good job, accepted into university, found myself and became independant.
I had been accepted to study abroad for a semester which has always been a dream of mine to travel to this particular country.. even better I've been able to live here for 3 months instead of having a short visit. 
Umm...... since arriving I have been overcome with depression + insomnia and have barely attended classes at all.... I had other issues in the past that have sparked up since being here. 
Now I only have 1 month left and this feeling has stuck with me consistently. Safe to say ruining my whole experience. 
Not only has this ""life changing"" experience been the complete opposite of what I envisioned and hoped. I am completely aware that my depression will be an ongoing battle forever... before arriving here I  thought I had overcome my depression due to my  progress in the last two years. 
Weird how I was doing so good back home and since being here everything is turned upside down for no reason I can truly identify. 
Now I assumed It could have been because I'm in a unfamiliar place, not close to loved ones, missing home etc. But to be honest coming overseas was perfect timing as back home I was frustrated and ready to get away and continue to improve my life. 
It's been a rude awakening and I'm still unsure why this could be occurring when I was wanting and looking forward to the change.. and not necessarily missing home. 
I have 3 papers due in 3 weeks. I havent been able to concentrate and even begin.
My family are expecting me to excel while here and I'm ashamed of how I have deteriorated since being here.
I am active, I know how to combat my depression in ways but its lingering like the m****** f******* it is.
I'm disappointed in myself and know I have wasted an opportunity of a lifetime. 
tldr: a lifetime experience + opportunity has turned out to be nothing like I thought due to being struck  by recuring bouts of depression for no identifiable reason.",1
dev_pid_2223,"I feel it coming back what can I do? : I haven’t been depressed in 3 years but i feel it creeping back, what can I do?",1
dev_pid_2224,"How should I kill myself (question) : I’ve got three or four options
One the weak ass pellet gun I have done stairs I doubt it will do it but what’s your opinion?
Two unfortunately also weak ass ibuprofen and Tylenol (acetaminophen) which probably means kidney or liver failure which might be painful
Three the knife
The most painful option down the stream of course I’m trying to accomplish something
4 suffocating myself to sleep
The most peaceful option in the end although I suppose the knife would be peaceful in the end as well but I would be in a very large amount of stress but I’d end up having dmt shot into my brain and voila I’m drifting
5 any other option that could be in a random house hold that you guys know of preferable the most least painful 
Note: if you give a self help line I’m doing the secret option number 6 I do a nose dive off of my balcony not killing me but just breaking most of my bones",1

I’ve felt like a fraud this year with Imposter Syndrome.
I’ve really been researching this, and is why I even have a throw away account.
Even my dream gigs haven’t brought happiness. I’ve had to hide myself even more because I work for a Production company (Top 3 in world) that would now even allow me to say what’s up. They have a + in their new monopoly  if that makes sense

dev_pid_2226,"Need advice on my addiction and the underlying emotions that caused it : Should probably be posting this on r/addiction but cant seem to get a response. To give some background im 14 (M) and have a physical and emotional dependency on weed. I have also dappled into shrooms and perscription adderall. First smoked when i was 13 (by myself) and immediately fell in love with it. For a while it was an occasional thing maybe once every 2 months but when I moved after my parents divorced things changed very quick. I moved in with the man my mom cheated on my dad with and that left me with alot of mixed emotions. My mom has the right intentions for me and my siblings, but she just cant seem to excecute them correctly. She is always on edge and she also is very controlling about what I look like and how i dress. On the other hand my dad is very caring but he has an extreme temper and had a past addiction of adderal and alcohol. So these emotions i had left me very depressed for a few months and i started smoking everyday (1-4 times a day) so I could always have that euphoria that distracted me from these emotions.And here I am now, currently going through withdraws because I ran out of weed. Bottomline I just want to some advice on what I need to do at this point. Is my brain permanently fucked? Its been everyday for 5 months now so I dont think theres a whole lot I can fix. :/",1
dev_pid_2227,"Feel like I’m made a huge mistake : Im almost 23, which feels like I’m too old to be making this kind of dumbass decision. I’m just starting in a job I already hate, and every night I get back from work I break down into tears, but not before getting right back into work since a lot of it is taking 6 hours of work home with me right after a 9 hour shift. I have a chronic illness which has me needing a consistent nine to ten hours of sleep to stay in good health... So I haven’t had time or motivation for any of my hobbies or my deep passions.
On top of that, the work itself is exhausting on multiple levels. Emotionally, physically— my feet and head and chest kill me at the end of every day. All the things that made life worth living feel bleak. Even eating brings me no joy.
I have lost 15 pounds this month alone. I wear a smile and laugh and go through the motions but I feel like I’m on the verge of cracking, and my face looks like Skeletor more and more everyday.
I hate my job and I feel like the skills here will never transfer to another profession, and that no one will ever hire me so that’s why I had to take this job. Other people in this field told me how they tried, and failed, to leave. They say, for all the sleepless nights and unpaid overtime and premature balding, at least it’ll keep me financially stable. But at this point I’m so stressed out I’ve considered hurting myself just so that I don’t have to consider quitting vs potential homelessness and poverty. Everyday I question why I still bother getting out of bed, and it’s due to the fear of being a disappointment to all the people who have supported my dumb ass through so much.
I’ve never felt this low before in my life, and every night has me feeling ohysically pained from how stressed I am before work the next day. There’s other small factors, but this job is sucking my life out of me. I feel too much guilt and pressure from family and peers to leave. I don’t know if I deserve to be happy, to di what I always dreamed of, or if I should just suck it up and hope a car crushes me by accident one day. Will I at least get an oppurtunity to be happy in retirement?",1
dev_pid_2228,"The things that hold me back : A lot of the time when depressed people talk about what holds them back from ending it all they talk about these things as being good, but I don't feel that way.
I wish that the people in my life didn't care about me. I wish I didn't have responsibilities. I wish there was nothing and no one that relied on me. If that were true, then I would be free. I'd be free to let it all go. To just die, and be away from the torture of life. I don't want to live, but I feel I have to.",1
dev_pid_2229,"im so ready for it to be over : i honestly fucking hate being alive, and its ""bad"" for me to kill myself. people are forcing me to be alive when i absolutely fucking hate it, im not happy and i dont know how to be. i do NOT want to be alive, why cant i just chose to die right now? why does everyone take all the sharp objects or lock away anything i can use to hurt myself. i do not enjoy being alive so why do i have to do it, why cant i just fucking die already. i want to take the easy route and just not be alive anymore",1
dev_pid_2230,"Don't do what you love for people that don't love what you do. : Depression has seriously been kicking my ass around the past month and a bit, so I thought it was time to create a dedicated account to vent my worries.
Was a talented coder when I was younger, won national championships and so on. Fast forward, health got the best of me and I ended up needing surgery or otherwise I'd die. This went fine, and even got into Uni on time with the rest of my peers my age. Ended up studying mathematics &amp; comp sci for a year before the rent became too much for someone that was doing freelance and I had to move home.
In order to pay for Uni locally, I started working. This job went shit with new management and they basically just used and abused me to make their systems Government compliant so they could start taking on Gov contracts.
Got poached about a month ago by a much larger company, which is a nice feeling. The part they don't tell you though, is that when they work you this hard, you burn out and end up hating everything you loved to do. I have no passion anymore, and my head constantly hurts. I'm constantly dazing off and I have been feeling physically ill for the past 3 months, but every doctor says it is nothing.
So, as I sit here at work, constantly thinking of how I would love to jump out the window and end it all, just to be over with it.
And knowing that I'm going to go home just to sleep another 14 hours just so I don't have to think about the depressing day I'll have tomorrow, and knowing that I have nothing left that I like, that I have no motivation. I don't even care about the money anymore. I've had to drop out of University and leave the one last thing I loved doing, just so I can afford rent &amp; to feed myself.
So with all that out of the way, for the younger ones about to enter the adult life, take this advice: *Don't do what you love, if you aren't working for yourself or for someone that doesn't love what you do. They'll always end up stealing it from you, and that will make you hate it. You will be left with nothing.*",1

The worst part about feeling like you have no control over your situation is knowing that you do, but you don’t have the motivation to do anything. It is all my fault and I deserve no sympathy. 
I’m only holding motivation towards my hobbies. It’s the only thing keeping me from sleeping all day. It’s not healthy.
I hate myself and almost constantly want to kill myself. I push away people I love because I think I’m not good enough for them. Every little mistake is a reason.

Im so awkward and weird, be who you are and people will accept it. Yea been trying that for years and people enter and seem really nice for maybe a day at most. Then they leave it. 
I feel like I got left behind somewhere. Like I am missing something. The only good thing is my dog.
I feel like theres nothing inside me anymore. I cant get up to even game or workout anymore. Theres no motivation. All I have are insecurities that build with each passing year. Im tired of being a fuck up, tired of trying. I just wish I was normal. I wish I was happy.

Now I don’t even know if I get to go since I also deleted my Facebook account and now I can only contact 2 of my friends from my group. Nothing I do will ever fix this mess. The thing that hurt me the most is that he said. He doesn’t gain anything from our friendship and he won’t lose anything either. I just hope I don’t have a breakdown anywhere public.

dev_pid_2237,"Self biography/story : My Addiction to Pain
     For the purpose of this story and to keep my identity a secret I am going to be going by the code name ""FireFly"". Nah I'm just kidding. Instead you can call me Koid. Yea I know. I know that's a weird ass name. Dont judge me. I suck at making up names. I dont have the imagination I once had when I was a kid so deal with it!
  Well now that we have somewhat of an introduction to who the protagonist, the hero, the savior of this story is! (Me). You're probably NOT asking yourself why am I reading this. So maybe you should ask yourself that. Did you ask yourself that yet? Yea? Ok good. Well my good reader that's an easy answer. You read my title. I mean come on now. Isnt ""My Addiction to Pain"" a good ass tittle? DOES THAT NOT GRAB YOUR ATTENTION? Sorry sorry. I get carried away sometimes. But anyways that answer to your question should be answered later on. And only by you. I can't answer that for you. I don't know why you read random stuff online or if this goes big then from a book store I don't know you! Sorry again. I don't mean to yell. 
   Well my friend. I want you to ask yourself this second question. What does this title mean to me? No, not you me. Koid. So what does it mean? Anyone? Really no one? Well fine then. I guess I'll answer this myself. The title of this story means absolutely nothing to me. But at the same time absolutely everything. This title is the embodiment of my life. Hell, this title is my life. Hence the whole ""My"" in the title. This is a story of my struggles in life and what I had to overcome and what almost made me take my own life. This is the story of a man who has known nothing but pain for such a long time that he realized it was the only thing constant in his life. The only thing he knew to be true. He knew this feeling so well he fell in love with it. He fell in love with a feeling of dread, quilt, and despair. He fell head over heels for it and he didn't even know it. But why does this mean nothing to me as well? Well my reader. From the good words of Thomas Shelby ""This addiction is in the past now. And the past is no longer my concern."" Actually he doesn't say it exactly like that but it's close enough to the point where if someone who's reading this saw the peaky blinders then they'll know I totally ripped that off from the show and I don't want to be used. So better to be safe than sorry.
     And before I continue I want you to know something. I am not a writer. I suck at grammar, I probably won't use the correct words or proper paragraph styles. I'm not an English teacher. Shit the last time I read a book to its entirety was back in highschool. And even then I used the fuck out of sparknotes to get through that class and at least have somewhat of an understanding of what I was reading. I'm about to turn 22 by the way at the time I'm writing this. So yeah. If there's any english major's reading this or teachers or just anyone who knows how to properly write a book or essay. Please bear with me. 
     I'm going to be honest with you guys also. I don't know where to even begin. Do I start from the very beginning?  Do I tell you guys how 2019 shaped up to be the worst year ever? Or do I tell you about my most recent relationship with my ex girlfriend? I don't know yet. I'm just winging this here. But whatever I choose to begin with, I really hope you guys stick around for the ride. And possibly enjoy it? No, this is going to be a depressing tale, or maybe it won't be. WHO KNOWS? But I do hope this helps whoever needs it. Whoever needs help to move forward in life like I am doing and understand why you're doing what you are. Please enjoy.
CHAPTER 1: A Tale of Dead Romance 
So here goes. My last relationship was way over before I even knew it. I was with this girl for quite some time and I didnt even know our relationship had already ended. What do I mean by that? Well, she and i were at a rough spot for a while. Constantly fighting constantly arguing over stupid things. But me being the idiot I was, I thought that was normal. You know?  Like every relationship they show on TV or have people tell you, you'll always argue with the significant other. That's just life. That's ""NORMAL"". But I was a fool when it came to this. I didnt know she and I had already drew our last breath in this relationship. I didnt know she had already moved on and found someone else. I dont blame her. I really dont. She and I had been in a tight spot for a while. Where she and I would argue almost every night over such stupid little things. 
It's funny to be honest. Looking back now. Those fights are kinda what I miss most now. Because with every compromise she and I made I knew she cared. Even if it was a little bit. Maybe I should have been more supportive on her endeavors. Maybe I should have been there for her. Maybe I should have continued to monitor the situation and adapt to her to keep her. These are the thoughts that keep up at night. These are the reasons why I dont sleep. Because I think about her every night. Right now it is March 8th 2020. We broke up on November 18th. On her birthday when I went to go and see her. Yet I lie here awake at night not able to sleep thinking about what we could have been doing right now. What we could have been talking about. What we could have been planning. Not a day has gone by where I haven't thought about her… 
I promise you reader this has never ever been me. I was never one to be like this. Sure I've always been lonely. I've actually always liked being alone. To be in my own bubble. Away from society and family. Just on my own. But nowadays… while I still crave to be alone in my thoughts I get upset because I know theres no one thinking of me. I know that at night I wont be able to sleep with someone on the phone or have a night call with. You may be telling yourself ""well why dont you find someone else to do all those things with?"". It's just not that simple. I got torn down when she and I broke up. I became someone I didnt even recognize anymore. When I look in the mirror I don't even see myself anymore. I see a lost soul looking for something that is out of my grasp out of my understanding. Out of my comprehension of what I am feeling right now. Have you ever felt this pain? This suffering that all you want to do is get better but cant? That when you see a happy couple you cant help but imagine but to remember that's how you used to feel like? This darkness, this pain, this hollowness that I have in my heart is the only thing I have know these past 4 months. And everytime I try to move on..  I just cant. And I dont know why.",1
dev_pid_2238,"I'm giving myself a week and if I can't find a solution, I'm just leaving this world : I doubt a lot of people care, but forget about it. I can't take it anymore. It's been almost a decade. I've tried almost everything I can think of and I'm just done. Done.",1

""Chase what makes you happy"" Nothing does. ""Spend more time with friends"" I have like 2, and I don't want to bother them for fear that they'll abandon me if they realize how deeply broken I am.

dev_pid_2241,Why am I always on the verge of slipping into the abyss? : I'm very bi-polar yet no one in my family has ever acknowledged it. I have to work very hard to act normal and I have found that writing songs or making art really helps to keep me on the level.

Even during the divorce I was not super miserable. But ever since last month I’ve been really in-motivated, sad, and depressed. It’s getting really bad, kinda suicidal, just really self loathing. I don’t know how or why this is happening, and just wanted to vent to strangers on the internet. Thanks for reading",1
dev_pid_2245,"Will I ever feel whole? : I don't feel like I have a right to be depressed. 
I know that's not how depression works and it's not some badge of honor, but I feel guilty for being depressed. 
I'm successful in most aspects of my life. I have a good paying job at 23 that I'm doing well in and have real career prospects. I have both deep friendships with a large group of guys who live on the opposite side of the country and strong friendships in the new city I live in. I'm not doing too poorly socially, if I need someone to hang out with or go on a date. Loving family with a distinct lack of any traumatic events growing up.
When I set goals, I usually end up achieving them. I've developed some interesting and diverse hobbies.
Why is it never enough? My dream is to be a good father and husband to my family. But I'm afraid that it still won't be enough. I'll still feel lonely when I'm with my family and friends. 
I'm a stupid romantic so I fool myself into believing I'll find someone who'll take away that loneliness. But I know that's not a fair thing to put on someone and somehow I'm supposed to solve it.
My chronic depressive episodes are short enough that I've never considered going to a therapist or going on antidepressants. I don't even know if antidepressants would have an effect. 
TL;DR: More or less perfect life on paper, still feel alone. 
Anyone dealing with something similar? Any advice, thoughts, etc?",1
dev_pid_2246,"Who else has zero ""emotional motor""? : There is nothing at all in life that is worth doing. I want nothing. I find so little flavor in any day-to-day activity. There is nothing forcing me to learn new things and there are exactly zero people I want to meet, and zero ways to make me happy.
I genuinely think every wholesome part of my personality just died a few years ago. Like my inner child isn't there anymore.",1

dev_pid_2248,Depression and death : Don’t feel bad that you are sad when others see you have the “perfect life”. Depression isn’t because your life sucks depression is medical and it’s about yourself. You could have the perfect life and be on top of the world but do you like yourself and do you want to live? I don’t talk about anything anymore because I’m tired of people pulling the “others have it worse” card.

dev_pid_2250,"Anyone else wish they could fall into a coma? : I don't like life very much right now. There's a lot of problems I have which have no real possible answer, and my favorite thing to do is sleep because it numbs my brain from stuff like this. I don't want to kill myself, I don't want to cause any distress like that to my family, so I wish I could just slip into a coma one way or another.
I just need, any sort of extended break from reality, holy fuck. Sleep is a nice break, but it does not last long at all. I'm only 17; I don't have it nearly as bad as most others here do, I apologize. But just, nothing feels special about life anymore. Things are kind of difficult now, but looking at the future, it only looks like things are going to get even more difficult, and that's something I wish I could veer away from, but it doesn't look like that's within my power.
I don't want to die, I'm scared of finding out what's on the other side, but stuff like sleep and comas are pretty much as close as one can get to being dead without actually dying as far as I'm aware. Thanks for reading my vent, I hope you have a great day.",1
dev_pid_2251,"Trying to make myself feel better is always the hardest part. : Starting this by apologizing if some sentences run on for too long. My sentence structure gets really shit when I word dump.
The people that I’m able to feel like are my friends always commend me for being so positive towards them all and helping when I can, and I have a strong will to help others. But when it comes to myself it’s like everything I stand for is just gone. 
I recently had to move last year and it made me lose my best friends for 8 years to a 8 hour distance. My parents have a back and forth relationship where they both want to be together for me and my siblings but the two things they can never agree on is money/work and how to best take care of their kids so their back and forth arguing and my father being in and out the house just makes every other week awful. 
Ever since I came to this school I had one year where I was overly lonely and broke down on the drive home in front of my parents because I couldn’t make any real friends. I never go to any events because nothing about this school feels right for me to go to them. Hell im having issues doing the last few things required to graduate.
But it’s like I just stay in my room almost every day because I have nothing else to do and no one to talk to, I’m able to tell others how they have a great future ahead of them as long as they keep their head up but every time I’m met with a roadblock all I think about is how I’ve become a disappointing son as the oldest child in my family and I’m a bad role model for my youngest sibling. And that at some point both my parents will finally clue one that I really might not be going anywhere.
 I have my moments of aspiration but they leave just as fast and I’m back at square one where I can’t find any resolve to want to leave my room. I know that I need to have the strong will to beat the bad thoughts away but it’s hard because I feel like there’s no person who really sees me as their favourite or the person they always wanna check up with and see if they’re ok. My friends know that my life isn’t great, just that I’m usually positive. I just want the subconscious feeling that someone else I know personally thinks about me and hopes I’m okay rather than me only occasionally popping in and out of their mind as the “oh yeah, he’s pretty cool.” But I never want to ask someone a question like that because it just feels like they’ll do it but only because they’ve been prompted to. Leaving me feeling like they do it more so out of moral necessity than me just being someone they actually care for very much.
I never know how to phrase these things because whenever I type shit like this I usually delete the draft just thinking that I’ll be seen as overly needy and maybe I am, but sometimes I just want to be able to think I have someone close to me that really does want to make sure that I’m doing ok, or have the feeling that I’m someone’s favourite out there and not the one who’s just slightly average at everything and isn’t anyone’s actual first choice.",1
dev_pid_2252,Anyone ever lose someone close to them and just can’t shake the feeling you could have done something? : About 3 ish years ago I lost my ex girlfriend to heroin. It was the worst If not the worst thing to happen to me. I had been incredibly depressed for a long time and still to this day I dream of her. She and I had this connection I couldn’t explain to anyone. We just FIT if that makes sense. When she died I didn’t beat myself up over it but lately I have and it sucks because I know there was nothing I could have done. But sometimes I wish I could hop in a time machine and change it all.,1
dev_pid_2253,"Never been to therapy but want to : I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for about 5 years now (23yo) and would most likely benefit from therapy.  I don’t like to self diagnose but I’m about positive I would be diagnosed with depression, GAD, and OCD and potential other things I don’t know as much about.  While I’ve been think about going for years (and my issues are only getting worse) for some reason I can’t get myself to go.  I literally have nobody to talk to about these things and have never told anyone about these issues either.  I have so much I want to talk about but I can’t commit to going.  I have this deep feeling that my problems aren’t valid and I think that’s why I have problems reaching out for help.  Has anyone else been in a similar situation and went to therapy? How did it go?",1
dev_pid_2254,"I don’t know what normal is supposed to feel like. : I spent the last decade on opiates, most of that on methadone. I’ve been off them for over a month now, with the help of some comfort meds to ease the withdrawals. The worst of that is over, but now the depression is starting to kick in, and hard.
I don’t know if I’ve always been this way, my arms and legs are scarred to hell from cutting when I was younger. I’ve been hospitalized for a suicide attempt once over stress at school. I remember struggling with depression, hallucinations and anxiety as a teenager, but everything after the opiates is a blur of diagnoses and medications. And I don’t know what was caused by the drugs or what was actually wrong with me.
But this time it’s different. I have no motivation. I spent the weekend staring at my phone screen, didn’t even have the energy to pick up the TV remote. Random crying spells. Anger and stress over the simplest things. All the things I used to love to do, even though I’d like to do them, I just can’t bring myself to actually do. Everything I do seems pointless, it’s an endless repeating cycle. I don’t see the point in living. I have a husband and pets that I care about, but that’s the only thing keeping me going at this point.
Does anyone here have experience with depression after stopping opiates? I knew it could happen, I just don’t know if this is just more withdrawal symptoms or if I’m actually falling back into a major depressive episode. My next appointment with my psych is a month away, the rational side of me is telling me to call and reschedule for sooner. I’d prefer not to spend another week in a psych ward if I can avoid it, and it feels like I’m heading that direction again.",1
dev_pid_2255,"Good evening : Hey everyone, 
I’m writing pretty much to get things off my chest. I don’t really know what to say so this will all seem a bit rambly so please bare with me. So, I’m depressed and probably suicidal (I say probably because dealing with absolutes is scary.) Anyways, I can’t really turn to a therapist since the career I’m going to school for requires me to have never been forcefully hospitalized for mental issues. So here I am typing things out to a bunch of strangers when I should be trying to sleep. I thought about killing myself tonight. Had a gun to my head and was about a third of the way through pulling the trigger when I finally gave up. I called myself dramatic and beat myself up a bit for the admittedly low point. This isn’t even close to the first time I’ve done this either. I went on my first date since my ex and I broke up. Usually I have my ever-faithful shield of pessimism to keep me from getting too hurt but this time seemed to be going well and I thought for once I was good enough and that I did something right. And then this morning I was blocked on everything so.. yeah that stung. And I don’t really have many friends to lean on either so every crisis, every sleepless night, every “maybe tonight’s the night where I shut it all off” is handled by me and me alomne. I do have friends mind you or, rather I think I do. I don’t really know. Every time I reach out they’re too busy or are finally just fed up with talking to me. I’m sorry if I’m going on too long thank you to anyone who has hung in there with me. Anyways I should probably rest. Thank you and have a lovely evening.",1
dev_pid_2256,"How do you find a job when you’re depressed? : I’ve been at my current job for 5 years now and I hate it. I’m lucky in the sense that I have managed to still show up everyday and not get myself fired or quit on a whim. I used to really like my job and had a great sense of pride in the work I do. It’s mostly a boring 9-5 job, nothing special, but I’m really good at it. I spend a lot of time by myself, which I like but I’ve always had to pick up my coworkers’ slack, never get much recognition for my work, have to do a lot of my bosses tasks that I shouldn’t have to do while he gets the credit for it, etc. And then, the past year, my boss’s boss has implied more than once that I am overpaid for what I do while cutting my hours intermittently while business has been slow (then giving me extra hours when it’s busy.) 
I should have left a while ago, I know. I started looking for a new job a couple months ago. I’ve applied to about 60 places and have only gotten 1 interview. I’ve been applying to similar jobs to the one I have right now with the same salary, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less. I feel like I should be getting more call backs than I have. The 1 interview I had, I thought I was the prefect fit! When I didn’t hear anything back, I thought they must have found someone more experienced or had a degree (I don’t have one.) But after 2 weeks from my interview, I saw they refreshed the job ad online. 
I feel like my job has really negatively affected my mental health and my self esteem is pretty non-existent now. Job hunting has only been making it worse and I know I have to really put more effort in if I’m going to find something but it just seems impossible at this point. I’m starting to believe that I am overpaid and don’t have anything good to offer to a potential employer in the field I’m trying to work in, and it just makes me feel worthless.

dev_pid_2262,"C*ronav*rus Depression : My city has been hit with ~~disease redacted.~~ Not as bad as some, but my office is so susceptible (I've been sick 5 times in a year since I started there, and once it was for 3 solid months), and I live with an elderly mother, and spend a lot of time living with my boyfriend, a smoker not in great health, and his elderly mother. 
I've been having crying panic attacks about it killing my mom (who also is a smoker and has neurological issues to boot). She's been separately depressed lately, and I've only been making it worse by being sad. I want to enjoy my time with her, but it's so hard because my intrusive thoughts have been getting worse and I can't stop imagining the inevitable phone call of her dying in her own sh\*t seizing out. Or my boyfriend. Or my other friends. Or even people in my office. My dad and his wife are traveling regardless and my dad got cancer removed from his arm recently.
Separately, one of my best friends recently stopped talking to me because my anxiety is ""a burden,"" essentially calling me a bad friend--even when I was there for her. She works with me, and that's on top of the other people at work who hate me because another ex-friend of mine (ours) lied about her being manipulative, and painted me as the bad guy. This feels so petty now with what feels like the end of the world--or at least the end of mine--and this is just the cherry on the sh\*t cake.
All of my ED garbage and self loathing and the actual *physical* depression that (I thought) my meds stomped out years ago are coming back in full force. I feel worthless and helpless. I need to see my doc asap to re-up on my meds, but now I don't even see the point. I don't want to die from this virus, and I'm too scared of the unknown to ever attempt s\*icide--nor could I morally do that to the people who love me. But I do just want to retreat in my thoughts and not exist, just be high as hell and not interact with anyone, to disengage. I used to be really good at dissociating emotionally but I'm not good at it anymore.
I just want it to end. I don't want to die but I don't want to exist. I think my world is collapsing in on me, and clearly, as my friend said, I'm a burden. Can't even enjoy time with my mom before she dies without bugging her out.

Alright, I'm not gonna hold you back since you're probably sitting down right now and complementing suicide - before I start, take a deep breath and relax.
I've had family, friends or strangers that I've met take their lives. It's no joke and its something to take seriously. Though, sometimes.. We cant anymore, we've given our best every day and we get nothing back in return and whats the point if there is no reward.
Well, there is a point. The point to show everyone that even in the darkest places, you are the **one** that stood up and showed everyone that was doubting you that you could take the hits. You could do it.
Most people that take their lives believe that nobody cares. If nobody truly cared, then nobody would find your body and report it. If nobody **TRULY** cared, then nobody would be at your funeral.
Again, most people that take their lives believe that there is no affect. They are wrong. If you look at those who've had a loved one take their life, then they will they you that there is a domino affect to this action. If you take your life, then close ones will be questioning themselves and trying to find out what they did wrong the rest of their life, and that ends them up in the gutter and it just drags on.
The point is, there is a reason to live and for the goddamn sake of my mentality, dont take your life because I care about you. I may not be able to see you through the screen, but trust me, and thats all I ask of you. 
If you feel like you are gonna do something disastrous, PM me or comment so I can PM you. If you dont want to sit there for hours and hear me rant/talk about random things, then call the suicide hotline @ 1-800-273-8255.",1

I feel out of love awhile ago, feel guilty to admit. The woman in with seems to be my biggest fan and puts so much faith into me. Maybe my perspective is off, but I really think that she is emotionally dependent on me and it's a drain; I'm her only friend it seems. I feel obligated to keep her happy and entertained; it's exhausting.
I always thought that if I hit a certain mark in my career, gained some sort of financial independence (I have these things now) that this feeling of dispair would go away, but it hasn't. (I laugh at myself that I'm motivated to write this BS on a Reddit post...it's therapeutic in a way).
Some history: depression does run in the family. Lost my sister and an uncle to suicide. My father made an attempt. I used to cut, but now I strike myself in the head when I get frustrated. I was addicted to methamphetamine in my earlier 20s and have been clean from that about 17 years. Last year I suppose I broke my sobriety with psychedelics; they've admittedly been very helpful. I am able to see things clearly.

I will go above and beyond to make others happy even a little but I never seem to impact anyone’s life. It’s like, if I am there, it’s okay but if I’m not, it wouldn’t matter.

Why would my exes cheated on me? Why do they keep on living me stranded, alone and hurt. It's my responsibility to heal myself from my trauma. But I can't do it on my own when someone that said they love me just hurting me with their words and actions.
I asked myself, am I that terrible? Am I not that worthy? Am I not good enough? Why? This feeling that I felt right now feels like that I just wanted to be disappeared from life. But in some way, I should stay alive for people who need me. 
When someone hurt you so much, why do I feel that I'm not enough? That I'm not worthy. That I'm not good enough for them, specially that one person that you thought that they will be the person that you can count on, to that person that promise you that he will takecare of you, to that person that promise that he love you? 
Do I really deserve this? What have I done that I deserve to be treated badly? What have I done that I deserve not to be love unconditional? 
I don't feel love from that people who said they love me. The unconditionally love that I have so far are from people that are friends. Other than that, it's a conditional love. A love that they give because they need me in their life to help them feel good about themselves, to support them financial, to give them comfort, to make sure that will always be love.
I'm so depress that why I do keep on failing in my love and relationship life with the person that I care about? Why would they hurt me so much?

dev_pid_2277,"Anyone struggling might find this helpful, so here it is : \*No theory or claim in this letter is based on scientific fact or has been in any way proven. The theories presented are of my own creation and have not been tested in any way. 
As an individual struggling with depression, the search for happiness has gone hand in hand with a search for survival. Strugglers of serious depression spend their whole lives in search of happiness. Depression is a journey for happiness, unique to each individual. One main misconception about ""curing"" depression is that other people know how to guide you on your journey. Happiness doesn't have a formula. Any doctor that claims to have a method for curing depression is a waste of your time.   
Many non depressed people hold individuals to societal standards and if individuals meet these standards and are depressed, people look at them and wonder why. I'm not an exception. I attend a prestigious university, am very financially support by very well off parent, have never had to worry about any basic human needs, have tons of friends, a girlfriend, and I'm doing well in school. But I also sat on my be also nightly with a knife to my wrist edging ever so close to choosing the easy way out. I cry myself to sleep every night out of self loathing and when I wake up, my first thought of the day is is this going to be my last day? 
Naturally, given my well off parents, I received every treatment / therapy you could imagine in my quest to shake my depression. None of it had any effect. I continued down the path of following recommendations and such on the internet and from professionals; that path drove me deeper and deeper into depression. My depression got to the point where I wasn't even sure if I liked my intermediate family anymore. One day, I snapped. I just left. Not for long, only about 6 hours, but in those 6 hours, I learned more about the way life works than I had in my previous 20 years.
In those 6 hours I learned the most crucial lesson anyone could teach you: you know what's best for you and you alone can best medicate your mind. When it comes to your physical health, it is best to leave it to the professionals. This is because anatomically, most bodies are the same. They are made up of the same stuff and operate virtually the same way regardless of the human. But this is the exact opposite for the brain. 
Every brain on planet earth is distinct and unique. I would describe the brain using the 90/10 theory. 90% of the human brain is a result of evolution. We all have the same survival instincts and similar traits that have resulted in humans arriving where they are today. This area of the brain allows us to converse, eat, sleep, and do everything ""normal humans"" do. Your 90% is what makes you human. However, it is the 10% of the brain where you find uniqueness among individuals. Your 10% is who you are, what separates you from other humans. Ideally, individuals will let their 10% loose and really express who they are. This is unfortunately very far from reality. As I have pointed out and will continue to, society isn't good for the individual. Society is a competition for materialistic things in order to prove you are ""better"" than someone. Due to the competitive side that exists in the 90%, societal expectations take control over your 10%, hindering you from truly being you. More on the process of taking control of your 10% below.
I'm still developing my craft as a writer and couldn't find a great way to transition to this paragraph, so here's a really awkward and out of place sentence. Social classes have certain expectations within that class and you are considered a failure in some respects if you don't meet these expectations. For the son of an upper class white male such as myself, the expectations look somewhat like this: go to college, graduate, get a job, make money, get married, have kids, retire early because you are wealthy. It didn't occur to me until my sophomore year (I had been dealing with depression for multiple years at this point) of college ""what if I don't want to meet these expectations?"" 
For some this is going to be a lot harder than for others. Accepting that you no longer want to fit into these societal expectations will often be met with judgment and criticism from the people you thought were your closest friends, sometimes even family. I understand more than most just trying to fit in in order to feel good about yourself, but I promise you that once you pursue what you are genuinely passionate and excited about, you won't care about other peoples opinions of you. The people who truly care about you will stay by your side regardless of how you live your life.  
It is my belief that depression is somewhat systematic, meaning the society we live in promotes unhealthy standards of living leading to an increase in depression in younger people. Take the risk to be your own person. Own your 10%.  
The 3 big takeaways
* ""Good"" ""Happy"" ""Happiness"" are all relative terms. Just because something makes you happy, doesn't mean it will make someone else happy.
* This one is more directed at parents. I understand that if the child is younger it is your responsibility to raise your kid as you see fit (I am not a parent and am in no way trying to give parenting advise). That being said, once your kid reaches around college age, as I have, they're old enough to start formulating their own decisions. If your child has been depressed over the past couple of years and you play a big role in their life, as hard as it is to do, you need to step back and allow your kid to pursue what he/she wants to pursue, not what you want him/her to pursue or what you think he/she should pursue. I'm not saying step completely out of his/her life, but as your child matures, it is important to take more of an advisor type role. As tough as it might be to watch your kid fail, we need to learn from our mistakes and learn from them.
* You know what's best for you. Don't be afraid to pursue what you love to do. Own your 10%.
Again, this letter is from personal experience and everything said does not necessarily apply to everyone, or anyone for that matter. I've struggled through depression and feel like sharing this experience could potentially help out other individuals, so here it is. Any questions, feel free to comment!",1
dev_pid_2278,"I dont fucking know what to do anymore : Im was and still am too much of a fucking coward to kill myself, i have been delaying it because of that but it does me no good. The more i tried to deal with my problems the worse it got. Its my 3rd year now and i cant have a single day without at least a single fucking mental breakdown. I cant stop going to school or to keep trying but it never changes. Everytime i see a problem on the board i start shivering, the lessons i used to love feel like torture. No matter who i talk to from the school councelor or my parents they dont or cant to anything the help me. Its the usual shitty facebook quotes like talk. Be happy love yourself and shit.

Im tired of being told that im unworthy....tired of the universe continually fuckin me over repeatedly....im tired of being full of tears but unable to release them.....faking being ok or worse tellin them that IM NOT OK and having that confession ignored......im on my last strike,1
dev_pid_2282,"Is it irresponsible to have a relationship and kids if the depression runs in the family : Let me start by giving a little context. My family is not the most mentally stable family out there. My father and his siblings all exhibited some form of mental illnesses. My aunt is diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Although my dad  always refused to see a professional, he shows clear signs of depression (I can’t tell the degree). My mom had seen a professional before and was diagnosed with major depression.
Me and my brother did not fall far from the tree either. My brother has shown the signs of apathy and he has been diagnosed with various degrees of depression. I have been experiencing depression in episodes. By now, I am familiar enough with the depression that I developed my own coping mechanisms. So far it has been pretty manageable. I have a fairly decent job, social circle etc. and I function to an acceptable degree (although maintaining these despite the depression sometimes feels like a chore and a half...)
The problem is I can’t form intimate and meaningful relationships with others. I had S.Os before and our relationship always suffered from my episodic depression. Now, every time there is a spark with someone, I feel like I should not pursue it as I don’t want to put the burden of my disability (seriously it feels like living with a disability by now) on them. It’s not obvious that I regularly suffer from depression and I feel like it’s not their problem to deal with. 
Also having a family history of mental illness kinda makes me wonder if it is a good idea to have a family of my own. If this thing really runs in the family, I would be dooming my kids to a broken life which they didn’t choose.
Is there anyone feel like this?",1
dev_pid_2283,"Stuck in a rut I can't get out of : I don't like to be negative, I feel like it just brings others down, but sometimes I just need to say how I feel and ehat I am going through. I am having difficulty functioning each day. I don't work because I was injured at work and left with a permanent injury. My husband goes to work at his minimum wage job with our only car and so I am left all alone. I don't have any family nearby. I don't have any friends here either, we recently moved from out of state. I just feel all alone and like life is pointless. We had to leave most of our stuff behind to move. I don't have any comforts like a tv, washing machine and dryer, couch, dresser, etc. I bought a tv second hand at a thrift store for $24. I tested it at the thrift store and it worked. After I got home, I plugged it in and it would not power on. The thrift store has a strict no refunds or exchanges policy. Money is tight, so I can't go buy another one. All I can figure out to do with my time is read books or go online on my phone (luckily my apartment has free internet). Sometimes I do a bit of coloring in adult coloring books, but I can only do so much coloring or scrolling online or other things that use my hands/arms because I have severe nerve damage in them. I can't do most hobbies other people enjoy due to the problems in my arms. I have little room to do any kind of exercise in my apartment. I have anxiety to go outside because I'd have to be on foot, and I know little about this new town and I have anxiety about crime, the Covid 19 virus goung around, etc, and I have next to no money to spend anywhere. There's not much within walking distance, no buses around, etc. We have a cat, but she kind of likes to do her own thing. Family works, has kids, etc and doesn't have much time to talk to me on the phone. I just feel so alone all the time, and like I have nothing to do with my time, and like my life is pointless. I can't volunteer because my disability pay doesn't allow it. I often find myself sleeping a lot to pass the time. I can't have children because I am infertile. I also can't do IVF because it is highly advised against because it may make my small brain tumor grow bigger. I just wish I had more things to occupy my time. I don't know what to do. I have depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I'm on medication, which helps, but life is just pretty meaningless when you always have nothing to do. Sometimes I do meditation, but I get bored of it. I get bored of everything because I have little to do with my time. I'm just hoping my situation will change, but I think it will take a long time. Any suggestions of what to do in the mean time?",1
dev_pid_2284,"I feel so unimportant. : I don't trust mental health services. Too many times have I been burned by them. I've been trying to get a psychiatric assessment for 3 months, due to me believing I may have BPD in addition to depression. No luck. I've been referred places, sure, but everytime, they turn me away for either being too severe or too mild of a case. My favourite line is when they say, ""sorry, this is an emergency clinic, so we have to turn you away."" Because at this exact moment I'm not going to kill myself.
I was so happy to finally see even a nurse after pulling tooth and nail to get somewhere, only for her to tell me to ""keep up the good work and wait for spots to open up"" on a program that has NO WAITLIST, is the only one of its kind in the city,  and doesn't tell people when they have open spots.
So, I would get better service if I tried to kill myself. People only really care when you're at death's door.",1
dev_pid_2285,"I think I’m ready and I just want to leave. : I have no ambitions or dreams. I am always losing friends, left and right. My parents don’t understand me. I’m tired of hearing “just go to psychiatrist and get some anti-depressants,” as if doping myself up every day will help with the actual problem that is MY mind. I can’t have anything good for myself, because I fuck everything up. I try to be positive, but I always feel my depression over my shoulder and just shitting on everything I want to believe in. 
People always say “you’re beautiful, you make friends so easy,” but I feel like the ugliest and fattest person I know. I never come first to anyone, and nobody ever really understands just how painful it is to live with depression. It’s not the same for everyone. For me, it’s literally like “I want to go to Japan,” and then immediately after I remember my lack of stable income and my mountain of student debt (also, no degree, a three time drop out because I was always breaking down.) Sometimes it’s “I want to maybe fall in love,” and then I hear this voice, distorted but my own, calling me an idiot and saying that no one will ever want me, you’re disgusting and unstable, you need to lose 20 pounds and maybe you’ll be decent. 
Do people really not understand the idea of your depression being you vs. every single one of insecurities on the most poisonous and obnoxious levels at all times? So much so that it becomes impossible to shut it out?
I can’t handle being alone either. I stare at my phone and realize I only have two people who are there for me, which is more than most. But I can’t help but feel like I’m a burden, always. It would be easier if their emo ass friend just disappeared. I’ve been feeling scared lately because .... all of my memories are mostly bad. Everything has been tarnished by my depression, one way or the other. I just can’t live day to day, trying to suppress tears every few hours. The idea of dying lately has brought a sense of calm to me, and that’s how I know I’m at the edge.
I just want it all to stop. I want to be a different person. I want to be normal. But instead I’m me, and sometimes I look in the mirror and just want to throw up. I truly do hate myself and I really, really hope I can make the decision to take my own life soon. I keep thinking about how I would like to die, and it soothes me. I don’t know if I want to overdose because I could always fuck up. I don’t want to jump because (haha) I’m afraid of heights and the spectacle. Lately, I’ve been considering carbon monoxide poisoning because I’ve heard it’s painless.
I’m already considering my methods of how take my own life and that’s how I know I’m ready.",1

Before the Covid-19 pandemic after college I started working in a job which has nothing to do with 5 years of education I got, it's a low skill job but I need something to pay for living. Got a girlfriend which I had crush for years and loved for a long time. We had ups and downs manly because of her character but it was going well. She started working in academic field. After that I realized she was not talking with me about her feelings or any stuff which bothered her, she rather talk with a coworker.
And here we are now, 1.5 month after lockdown and she just don't give a damn about talking to me, asked her via text message what is going on but second week she just ignores me. I don't bother to call her because she won't anwser.
During college I struggled with low self esteem and some mental problems, I fought it hard and got better at the end. But right now I know I wasted 5 years of education, work in a job which pays just enough to cover my monthy expenses and very little savings. Love deeply a girl which doesn't give a crap about me which hurts and was just a catalyst which threw me here. I live in a big city which is pretty expensive and to be honest I have nobody here, all my friends from college just went their ways, I stayed here because of the girl and now what else do I have here? Big expenses and nothing else.
I found that 2 glasses of wine after work is a great way to get to sleep, and do nothing else, it gets me just enough drunk to get some sleep, woke up with a low hedache and after hydrating myself easily going to sleep again till morning.
Right now I just exist, have nothing, mean nothing and seriously consider how a failure of a man I am. I have high blood pressure and need to take medicine daily, if not in a couple of years there may be a problem but I don't bother with taking it, I have no future, I see no future and the world is going to be the same place with or without me because there's nothing I bring of a value now.
I know I won't kill myself but right now I neglect my health to a point which in long term will bring me to premature end but hey, I don't give a crap right now, let future me handle all health problems current self throw at him.
tl;dr:
25 years old, masters in biology, works in a job which monkey could do, have nothing but expenses in a place of living. Have no friends.

It's been 6 years now and I feel worse every time. I don't know why I can't just be happy. Why did I have to be one of the ones who has to live like this. Why do I have to feel this way all the time, it never goes away, nothing distracts me anymore. I'll have some form of this for the rest of my life.

Say you're trying to.......find a path.
Well something that really helped me is crafting my vision first. I spent about 200 hours researching and figuring out what it was I wanted to do. Instead of just going out to flip burgers etc (just for the sake of staying busy). 
TAKE FREAKING TIME TO ASK YOURSELF HOW YOU WANT YOUR FUTURE TO BE.
So many people just go from retail job to retail job, not stopping and asking: what the hell is my future?
I even quit after my first day at a sweat shop factory because I didn't have a vision there. I was on break with a guy who looked like shit and asked him, ""how long have you been here?"" He said ten years.
I DID NOT WANT TO BE HIM AT 35. He was my anti-model.
Now I have crafted a vison. Thanks to Graham Stephan, Gabe Bult, and others.The vison is to be retired by 35 with part time math teaching.
Based on that I made steps. 
Steps:
Work at Local company, switch to higher paying job, save, invest in property, cycle properties, retire by 35, teach math and enjoy life and family.
Now that I have a vision, I will do whatever it takes because of I have already set my focus on the horizon. Everything in the middle are just steps along my personally crafted path.
But this is important: Find people who actually took paths similar to your vision. On youtube, on podcasts, and in real life. Make sure they were nirm people like you and made it work.
Model their paths. And go kick ass in life.",2

Eyes locked shut but peek to see
The view from halfway down
A little wind, a summer sun
A river rich and regal
A flood of fond endorphins
Brings a calm that knows no equal
You’re flying now
You see things much more clear
Than from the ground
It’s all okay, or it would be
Were you not now halfway down
Thrash to break from gravity
What now could slow the drop
All I’d give for toes to touch
The safety back at top

dev_pid_3772,"I wrote some depressing limericks that I wanted to share. Recently been going through a tough period and putting it into paper seemed to help : The mind that sings
The arm that stings
The void inside
The boy who died
A man who was not to be
The narcissist watches his life
As he prods and turns over his knife
His scars will go deep
So soon he will sleep
A slumber to escape his strife
Empty and hopeless his body
His mind feels just melancholy
Is this his truth
He feels like no youth
Why should a life be this shoddy
The blade entered his arm
Yet all that he felt was calm
Logic now shut and
Red from the cut
His life still rests in his palm
His time here feels like his own
Yet really it is but a loan
He exists as a brain
All he feels is his pain
And soon you will see his headstone
A noose and a neck walk into a bar
They turn to each other and know they won't scar
For a scar needs some healing
They look up at the ceiling
And know they won't make it that far
A man who was blind has died
Those whom he loved have cried
He needed a break
From his terrible ache
He found his way through suicide

Is not nearly as loud as what's left

dev_pid_3777,I know I'm still 11 but how do u deal with depression. I've been depressed for so much reasons like rejections and heart breaks : ,2
dev_pid_3778,"Get relief from Depression - A short guide : I am not a psychologist, but i do consider my self an expert in going through and getting out of depressive episodes. Have helped plenty of friends in the past, so i thought i d take the time for whoever needs to read this. 
This is my -GET BACK TO BEING FUNCTIONAL ASAP- guide. You obviously need to check out more books/therapy/treatment to completely heal from the roots. 
1. Running. 
Once you re depressed you ll either be super lazy and sleepy, or not sleeping at all, so both those will kill your drive for exercise, but this is something you really have to push yourself to do. I think running works best cause if makes you go outdoors. Any other exercise would do, but i couldn't personally do a team thing or be at a gym, so running is my best option. I 've run sleepless at 4am. It doesnt matter. If you 're depressed you have to kill that monster ASAP. 
2. Reading
I can't read fiction when i am going through an episode, but reading about depression and psychology has helped me immensely. I recommend ""LOST CONNECTIONS"" by Johann Hari and ""HOW TO CHANGE YOUR MIND"" by Michael Pollan. 
3. WATCH YOUR FOOD. 
Sure, binge on fast food for a while, or don't eat at all for a day or two. Then get back on track and plan meals with close friends so you HAVE to eat something normal, cooked well. If you re not eating at all, like I do when I feel like crap, after a while it will mess with your head as well.  
4. NO SUBSTANCES, ESPECIALLY POT. 
I am not a drinker anyway, when i am well i might smoke some pot a couple of times per week, which becomes DEADLY when i am not well. My mind will go down that spiral so fast on pot, i know i ll have a bad night. 
5. GET OUT. 
No TV, no couch. Plan something with close friends, tell them to invite you everywhere. You need to be out of home as much as possible, either hanging with loved ones, or working on something you like. 
6. MICRODOSING. 
This is a recent one for me, but it has worked wonders. In the past i ve been subscribed Prozac, Xanax, Remeron, etc. Nothing has worked as well as microdosing on psylocibin. It will give you energy, drive, it won't make you high, and you won't get intoxicated. Its as healthy, cheap and effective as it gets. I ordered a grow kit from HOLLAND and i grew the mushrooms myself, and i ve never taken another stupid, toxic pill since then . 
These tips help me, and i hope they ll help you. They work together, its not the same if you just do one of them, so don't just take shrooms and sit on your couch, you re gonna have a bad time. 
Again, i am not a doctor, i just consider myself experienced. 
Would love to hear your thoughts. 
Good luck to everyone.",2

She doesn't want to talk to me or be my friend. She never reaches out to make plans. If I didn't initiate things we would never see each other. Her and my Dad live together, so when him and I make plans I will see her and go say hi and bye. I always feel like I'm interupting her T.V. program when I do. If I try to initiate plans with her in person and that usually works. A little walk or brunch or a movie. I text her though and she never replies. Even to just the simple I love you or miss you. 
I feel guilty complaining about this. 
She wanted a child so bad. They tried for years to have me. She had a miscarriage before me. I feel like a disapointment. Like I didn't turn out the way she wanted and so now she's changed her mind. I hate feeling like this.
Some women do not deserve children. I know that might sound harsh, but no one deserves to feel the way she makes me feel. She makes me feel like I ruined her dream. I know she is most likely depressed just like me, but fuck man. This shit just hurts. 
Today is her birthday, and I was feeling bad because I have to work all day and won't have time to see her, then I remembered that she doesn't try to see me or call or text on my birthday. So I guess I have nothing to feel nad about. I shot her a text. It will be ignored as usual.
I just wanted to get this out somewhere. I feel guilty complaining about this because I know her and my dad did their best to raise me. But I am not grateful to be here. I am terribly depressed and question my existence at every turn. I feel like I am just a product of regretful baby fever. They were too stupid to realize that I might not come out the way they wanted. My dad has accepted me. My mom cannot.
The only thing I have going for me right now is to try and live my best life out of spite, so maybe one day she will see how happy I am and want a peice. And I will be there, to give her the same shit energy she gives me now.

dev_pid_3786,"Need help moving on : Hi all-
I should probably start this by saying that I don't think I have depression or a mental illness or anything like that, but I've never been sadder and lately I just haven't felt like myself and I wasn't sure where else to turn to for advice. 
So there's this girl in my close friend group who I have feelings for but she has made it pretty clear that she doesn't have an ounce of interest, although she still wants to be friends (idek if we're still friends though). Our relationship has become really awkward and strained and I feel like every move I make is the wrong one and makes it even worse.
Lately she's been feeling down and it makes me miserable to see her miserable, and I feel helpless knowing all my efforts to make her feel a bit better haven't done much. Everytime I think about this though I'm reminded of how little I'm worth to her compared to how much I care about her, and it's become this cycle of sad thoughts every night. 
At the same time, I've been dealing with some personal stuff and the little things I once appreciated just aren't as nice anymore. I don't even enjoy the stuff I once enjoyed. Like I recently hung out with my friends but as time went on I kinda just wanted to go home more and more. They're all great people though and they've given me good advice on how to move on, but it's proving harder than I originally thought. When I get home now, tbh I just sleep because at least in my dreams I don't have to face reality. I feel broken and don't have much motivation to do anything. 
At first, I thought it was slowly getting better but I came to the realization that it isn't after I started feeling sad sometimes at school, even though before I only really felt sad late at night. It's almost like it just accumulates over time. 
I'd really appreciate any input on what I'm feeling rn. Anything helps. Also, thanks to whoever took the time to read the entire thing",2
dev_pid_3787,"I can't stop overthinking todays events : So I donated blood for the first time today a d I feel happy that I could help even just a little. .But , the whole situation around it even though a normal one has bit one I've been overthinking since this morning and I think without posting about it somewhere I won't feel ok. 
So I recently moved form a small balcanic country to Italy. Since september of 2019 to be precise. 
The attending doctor complimented my italian surprised I had been for such a short time only in italy  but as I said I'd been watching italian tv since I was a kid and it could be the reason the very handsome nurse guy commented that italian is a very wide spread language in X(my country) and the doctor laughed about it . 
Now here comes the fuck up which I never meant to say but I said and as many times I reply the scene I regret saying it. 
So basically the doctor asked if this was my very first time donating blood or my first time in italy. I explained that I'd never done a donation in X because I was scared . Now the doc was very curious and a bit surprised as to why and I said that hospitals there are not very sanitary and its kind of a common fear to not donate blood . 
In fact this is the idea my PARENTS have and I by no means think that way. I've always wanted to do a donation but my mom and dad forbid it saying it was dangerous and I could contract a decease if I went to a hospital to do so in X.
 But somehow I ended up saying what my parents think instead of my true beliefs and  I feel bad for putting my country down like that feeling like I am in italy to escape a scary place. I'm here because the economy on X is even worst than italy. Livin in X  is basically surviving .
Anyhow it sounded bad and the doc laughed it off. 
To top it all my veins were very small and the nurse barely could find a decent one , and he practically stood there besides me holding my arms so the pressure would be ok and the blood would flow. 
I turned yellow right before it ended since my blood pressure dropped and had to be fed sugar water by the other nurse and I  could not even understand her when she asked if I could do it my self so fml.
At the end the nurse guy continued to say that the blood was a little less than it should be , the bag was still Wrigley. And he told me that at the end it wouldn't draw blood anymore so he had to stop it there. 
Everyone got up but they told me to stay there and he ( the nurse ) told the other donor buy buy cuz YareJare has to stay with us a little more and everyone was a bit worried if I was ok.
The who thing made me feel kind of bad. Like I couldn't even do a simple thing like that and on top of it my mom made fun of me saying I'm not  someone who can give blood so I shouldn't do this a second it. 
To be honest my parents always tell me I'm naive and stupid for wanting to things like volunteer work or blood donation and that Ill never be mature enough to understand. 
I feel like even today I disappointed them and my self . 
My dad though didn't sound so annoyed as he was when I insisted on donating blood (which is a 5 minute walk from my place so it doesn't even cost me time or anything) 
So in conclusion I feel like I had the most awkward encounter doing what my parents belittle me for.
Tl,dr: Trash talked about my countrie's hospitals while being overall the weakest blood donor of the day.
Also parents don't even support what I do",2

I've been battling depression so bad I've had to be medicated the whole time I was in law school. It's my finals in May. If I start now, I can pass. But no matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to do it.
I need to pass these exams. I need to do it so I can get a job, move out and finally be free of my toxic family. Right now I feel like even if I did that, I'd still be depressed, but I guess I'd have a chance if I did.
I'm going for therapy, I'm trying to eat healthy and meditate and do the things that might help me. But nothing seems to be working. The pressure is killing me. I know that if not for exams, I'd be sort of OK. I'm barely in a mental state where I can study though.",2

dev_pid_3840,"The same things that I am thankful for, I can be depressed about the very next day. : I am currently wallowing in my own self pity about things that I KNOW are not the end of the world. But I am unable to convince my subconscious of this. Yesterday, and honestly a lot of the days prior because I need to remind myself how blessed I am or this will happen faster, I was raving about how great my current situation is. I was viewing things from the perspective of how great things are and how much I have to look forward to. But instantaneously those feelings flipped on me today. I only have some semblance of an idea of what triggered this. I was listening to a podcast and they were discussing things they would like to do this summer.  I guess I couldn't handle the idea of somebody doing something I would miss out on, and I began to feel I had no way of keeping up. I want things to come to me effortlessly. I don't take into account that these people are at an entirely different stage of life than I am either. When a depressive mood sets in for me, I am unable to comprehend time. I no longer have the ability to understand that I can do so many things in my life because I'm only 23 and I have so much time to accomplish all of these things. But I guess the ""I am only__ years old thing"" is starting to wear on me. I have only been getting older when saying it without much to show for it. (Of course this isn't true, it's just the way I inexplicably feel). So when I start to think about the fact that I want to travel, or I want to make more friends, have more dates, whatever the case I begin to feel sad. I tell myself all the things that are holding me back from doing so. In my mind, I hate everyone and this is why I can't do this, I have dogs so I can't travel or really leave the house much, and finally it's because I am broke. Aside from me hating everyone, which is a deeper darker thing, the other two things just aren't true. So I really have no idea why I believe them. From this point, I began to nitpick every little thing about my life. Everything that I don't yet have that I feel for whatever reason I deserve. Everything that I have gone through that I feel is a negative is now amplified by 100 in my head. It began to eat away at me. I would like to have the opportunity to travel, I would like to have the opportunity to put myself first, I would like the opportunity to live a full life. This leads me down the rabbit hole of finding an issue with every single thing that exists in my life. Suddenly I wish the dogs weren't ""such a burden on me that I could travel"" though I know this isn't true and there are dozens of ways I could travel despite being a dog owner. I also love them more than anything in the world and I absolutely hate when I use them as a crutch to something that I don't do. I start to be unable to control my emotions and lash out verbally at them and anyone else around me. Which is a trait I gained from my dad and I absolutely hate. I usually am able to recognize it and today I was, and it's usually reminds me that I need to write it out and try to overcome. But when I try to write it out, I find myself getting stuck. I start to feel like I am being disengenuous with myself, and then I get confused about the way I truly feel about things.  
literally all of the things that I am depressed about, I was finding reasons to be grateful for just days prior. But, Suddenly my current living situation isn't enough, and I need to go shop for furniture and decoration and then my funds aren't enough and I need to be responsible and I'm such a piece of shit for being so materialistic. Then my body isn't good enough and all the work I'm putting in, in the gym is for nothing and I'm wasting my time. Then I'm just lonely and I need people around me but ""the universe isn't putting the right people in my life"". The hardest part is knowing that all of this is nonsense and on my good days I can poke holes in all of it. Unfortunately this isn't one of those days and all of those things seem valid to me even as I type.  
Anyway, sorry if I couldn't condense it in a way that made a lot of sense. I really want to be vulnerable and share on here, because I know so many people go through similar things. I really hope that people can relate and feel better. If you read, I hope this resonates with you in a positive way, thank you all for letting me share with everyone today.",2

Recently it hasn't been like that. I've been stressed on top of stressed by so many different things from different parts of my life, but people keep coming. And they share with me all their sad stories and situations. The worst part is that I empathize with them and understand why they want to do certain (potentially harmful) things, more than I pity them enough to give helpful advice.
It disheartens me so much to think that there's nothing for a person with the situation I'm described of to do. I hate it I don't want to think that way at all, especially at the expense of another person when they're coming to me expecting some life-changing advice.

It’s like it’s clear for a thinking ,empathetic individual that pretty much everything about this so-called reality is wrong .And most people prevent themselves from thinking about this on purpose.They distract themselves with “love”,family,friends ,some kind of purpose,but in the end it all comes down to the fact that pretty much everything is pointless and doesn’t really make any sense .
And in order to be a successful ,fully functioning individual in this society ,it is necessary that you suppress these negative emotions and stop thinking .They just want you to become a robot who does what he is told ,reproduces and doesn’t cause any kind of trouble.
It seems to me that depressed people just can’t help not being ok with the reality of this world .That’s why the society doesn’t want them .They think too much.They understand too much.They care too much .They can’t help not asking questions .They can’t be robots .",2

The worst advice someone with major depressive disorder could get would be... Don't talk to anyone about it. Once I did eventually find a therapist we shined a light on things. We realized there was a point where I stopped drinking to have fun and started drinking to cope- and that fucking blew my mind. My therapist was right- at some point in college I drank so I could temporarily say goodbye to my problems and the origins of that stem from high school (i'm guessing) It wasn't until a breakup and a couple suicide attempts that led me to get diagnosed. I wouldn't get out of bed because what's the god damn point?

dev_pid_3901,"I feel extremely depressed when my parents leave the house : I'm a teen girl. I used to be so excited whenever my parents went away, because every so often they would leave for a few days at a time and I'd have the house basically to myself. My sister lives with me, but she wakes up very late and comes home at dawn every day so I'm basically alone. I am extremely introverted, always have been. The thing I used to love more than anything else was being alone with my door shut tight so I could watch YouTube, read, crochet and play computer games all day. And I'd get pumped for staying up as late as I wanted, because it takes an extremely long time for me to fall asleep and I like being able to disregard time and do things when I feel like it.
Whenever my parents go, they never say a word to me and I find out later. I used to see it as a pleasant surprise. But now, when I see that they're far away (my sister set up a Life 360 for them so I can see their locations), I feel so incredibly lonely. I can't function when I'm alone and there's no pressure on me. My daily life is high-pressure because my school is competitive and I go to an academy where I do research/outside work. When I'm finally left alone and no one's pushing me, I automatically withdraw and avoid all of the responsibilities I'm used to. I just drift through the day, feeling empty, barely eating and distracting myself from everything. I get so detached. I forget about everyone else and stay in my room for days on end until they return, and then have to readjust to being a part of society. And the worst part is, when I do nothing with my time, I feel the guilt gnawing at me incessantly but I can't get the motivation to move. Even typing this is hard. And fuck it, what's the point of even writing all of this on a forum when nothing that you can say will ever fix how I feel or genuinely change me? 
When my parents leave, I suddenly feel how alone I truly am in the world. My mom died when I was 9 years old, and I remember vividly the moment when I saw her in the coffin. That's when it kicked in, that she was dead, that someone I loved was gone forever and the world would just keep on spinning. My parents (I have a really loving step mom) are really old to have a kid who's still a teen. My dad is 62 and my mom is 57. Both of them have had shitty lives and chronic stress. Whenever I look at them, I see the image of them in coffins, exactly as realistically as the memory of my birth mom. It's scary how real it is, and I know that every second that passes I'm running out of time to spend with them. I've cried so much about it and get anxiety every time I see their faces. It's selfish for me to want them to stay alive when it's their time to go. I know both of them would welcome death, because life has always been really awful. 
As a teen, it's uncommon to admit this, but my parents are like an anchor for me in the real world. I have anxiety which sometimes distorts my perception and makes me feel like no one gives a shit about me. My family often feels like the only safe haven for me, the only space where I matter and I don't just disappear. And it hurts how much they love me, unconditionally, and I feel guilty for being as inadequate of a person as I am. When I think about my parents' deaths, I think ""there go the only people who will ever love me."" 
Being alone reminds me of the real world, in which everything hurts and it feels like there is really no solution. And I know how pathetic I sound right now, trust me, but the truth is that I'm really immature inside and I still feel so lost and insecure in the world. Sometimes I wish I could grow the fuck up.",2
dev_pid_3902,"How to tone down the defense mechanism : So I’ve realized due to my anxiety and depression, and maybe slightly due to some toxic shit in my last relationship, I have a lot of defense mechanisms when interacting with people and the biggest one is constantly being on guard and keeping up a “mean” front. 
I know I’m not a mean person, there are a lot of people I like at my work for instance, I love making others feel good and if I can go above and beyond for someone I care about I will. I know I’m a nice person but for some reason I feel like I’m always pushing myself away from everyone and my joking behavior comes out as mean and people think I’m being too dramatic or too serious. I don’t want anyone to think I’m rude but sometimes that’s the tone that comes out first and it’s hard to control.",2

dev_pid_3968,"A new discord server based on mental health : Hello everyone,
I would like to promote my server here.This is a brand new server that is made by me and my best friend-Ari. We have realized that nowadays, humans mental are weaker than they think, though most of them know that.   
Good mental health means being generally able to think, feel and react in the ways that you need and want to live your life. But if you go through a period of poor mental health you might find the ways you're frequently thinking, feeling or reacting become difficult, or even impossible, to cope with. This can feel just as bad as a physical illness, or even worse.  
Mental health problems affect around one in four people in any given year. They range from common problems, such as depression and anxiety, to rarer problems such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.In many ways, mental health is just like physical health: everybody has it and we need to take care of it.  
Here is the server we are aiming for. We are a LGBTQ+ Friendly, Mental health support(mainly), Gaming, Anime, and Music Server for people to have fun in! 
\- This server is purely made by volunteers, and runs off a volunteer system, we are NOT professionals, we use experiences and self obtained knowledge, although we try our best. 
We are a community based around actually getting better, not self pity and wallowing, we will pick you up when you fall down, and we will support in every way that we can, but we will NOT waste our time on people that don't actually want to get better.
What we offer: 
Mental health Support(Venting channels, etc.)
Memes 
Anime
Gaming
Music 
Karaoke nights  
Gaming nights 
And tons more! 
Finally, we are still growing, this server will be activated as soon as you clicked the link below, we are looking forward for you to join and be a part of this lovely family!

dev_pid_3995,"Man my Uncle is doing terrible right now.. : My Uncle bought a miniature golf course. The guy he bought it from was 80 years old and wanted to retire. He spent about $650,000 on the golf course, which was half of his savings.
But here is the thing, to manage the golf course he had to move out of Richmond, Virginia, to Akron, Ohio. He bought a new house before selling his old house, only to find that his attic has tons of water damage. The repairs itself will cost about $175,000 when he only spent $235,000 on the house in the first place (this was in the 90s). The worst part about it is the house he bought in Akron (which is a REALLY expensive city to live in) cost about half a million. He took out loans expecting to pay it off because of how profitable miniature golf courses are, especially in a really upscale place like Akron, Ohio.
But the story gets worse. The Golf Course itself has tons of problems. Most of the clubs aren't PGA standard. The old owner was disobeying the law and dodging taxes to maintain a profit. When my uncle became a new owner, the PGA did a mandatory inspection, fining my uncle $25k and forced him to spend another $12k in repairs and equipment upgrades. On top of that, now that the golf course has such a bad reputation, he is losing business, and people are going bowling instead. For those of you that don't play golf, bowling and golf are rival sports. This is sinking my uncle into a serious depression costing him tons of money in therapy.
So anyway my family goes out to Akron to cheer him up, taking him to the Olive Garden. But my BITCH sister couldn't just be normal. She starts SCREAMING at my Uncle for supporting Joe Biden instead of Bernie Sanders. My sister then killed his pet goldfish he always takes to restaurants with him for good luck. My uncle has had this goldfish for 27 years. My sister made such a huge scene that my ENTIRE family (including my uncle) is banned from Olive Garden forever. Since my family (especially my uncle) is SUPER Italian, this was a huge blow to his ego.
So basically my uncle is in serious debt, his miniature golf course is failing, my sister murdered his goldfish, and on top of all of that he is also banned from Olive Garden (even on Sundays).",2

dev_pid_4075,"Anybody else has this problem? : im depressed for the first time since a few months and my life is starting to break, first maybe have a problem in school, which is devastating and now this:
my best friend who I know +10y is turning really arrogant in the past weeks especially since he started fucking one of his friends ex(i want to puke) which he finds himself to be a great accomplishment, and Its so disgusting on how he deals with me since they met, because without me he would be a virgin until 25 or so because I made him.
I gave him his style, he copied everything from me including my way I deal and talk with people, Im basically his father and he thanks me with all this, he started humble bragging or straight up bragging on how beautiful and exactly his type she is and how good she can give bj's (while she doesnt even swallow ahhahahah)
He just uses any situation to bring up he got a girl to fuck while I got one months ago, but I never ever told one unnecessary story about her because I cringe on trying to feel good because you got a girl
He reminds me how beautiful and exactly his type she is and if she gets thinner how she will be even more beautiful and Im really starting to hate him for that because he literally did NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING to get her, she just started writing with heart emojis to him after she broke up with her ex and thats the story on how they met,
Not that that isnt ok, just the way he feels like king arthur but not pulling excalibur out of the stone and rather pulling his dick out of one of the fat flaps which each beeing close to the size of a front tractor wheel and then thinking he's the next rocco siffredi makes me hate her and him more every time he starts saying her name.
Now I recently called him out for some shit hes been doing but he just started to change the wording a bit and its making me just depressed that you really cant trust anybody, I literally saved him from killing himself 2 years ago and I said it was my duty and thats what friends are therefore and he owes me nothing, except maybe (unspoken) beeing as good a friend as I am.
I would appreciate help in this as I just want his old self back because he is like a brother to me, but I start to feel this going away because of how he treats me.",2

We also have this water system that cleans the water by filtering it through salt, among other things and I need to let the water run for a good minute after I turn the salt system off before I water my plants so they don’t die. 
Anyway, after I finished eating dinner with my family, I helped clean up the area but my mom was washing the dishes and I needed to take the compost out to the greenhouse since there was a full bag. It was getting cold and dark outside so I asked my mom if it would be okay to turn off the salt system to water the plants. I honestly didn’t think this was going to be such a big deal, if she just told me “no, sorry I’m washing the dishes right now so I kind of want it on” I would’ve been like “okay, I’ll wait.” But instead, she made this face and sighed loud as if she was exasperated then continued to say “I am washing the dishes, can you not see?

flashback when i was having job interviews after another and kept getting rejected due to my poor verbal communication skills but this job accepted me anyway.
flashback to that one person who interviewed me in my current work who is now my boss.
flashback to when i met two other people and their work team that somehow adopted me into their team as well despite my weakness.
in a way, i had two work families, despite the warning tweet i first read about not letting anyone in.
these two families somehow, at least made me forget how i don’t even know what to do with my life.
these two families somehow, made me forget a high school and a college life i wanted to forget.
these two families somehow, saw something within me that made me feel worthy of staying here.
these two families somehow, wants me to move out to another team to a client that they say would make me progress my career better.
progress my career? that’s a good thing right? but why am i crying?

I got help since and I’m doing better. Not suicidal. 
I didn’t want them to think I’d cut myself. I mean, why the hell would I cut the sole of my foot. My right foot?? 
I can’t drive or work or walk without crutches for at least 2 weeks. I kept it a lie because I didn’t want to worry them.

So I got pulled out of school and was homeschooled. Since then I have been diagnosed with depression anxiety ocd and Tourette’s. It makes everyday and impossible challenge. Fast forward to about a month ago. I’m now in tenth grade and have a absolutely no social interaction whatsoever. It still made me depressed but it got a little better over time. I texted one of my old friends and we actually talked and played on ps4 a little bit. I was beyond happy I actually had someone to talk to.

Once, we were arguing and she told me I was addict to my phone and that she thinks I'm facetiming people after ""screen time"" turns on and her brother became an addict because he had too much freedom, so I get **none**. She said that I was hiding people in my life from her who I was facetiming after she thought I was asleep. I told her that this was not true but she wouldn't listen. Other times she thinks that I'm sneaking out of the house. I don't, I promise you that I don't. How do I get their trust? How do I make my uncle not an addict? 
I get straight A's. But all I get is what I could do better and I don't understand. She says I'm too mean and she's right. All I want to do is move far far far away and never see my mom again. Only visit for my Dad. I just feel so alone and like no one else. I can't do anything that any other teenager does. Honestly, I dont know if I'm depressed, I don't really feel anything anymore, just sudden bursts of emotion. Everytime I talk to my Mom I cry after and feel like I'm not enough and I don't talk to anyone. I think I might go and become an addict just to spite her haha.",2
dev_pid_4133,Just want to talk to someone real : I find myself at ease being alone but at times I really miss the social aspects of life. Just talking to another human being with no judgmental views and being in the present. I wished I had more. More Proper interactions in life. My life is so boring and dull. I'ts so difficult to get out of this rut. I'm becoming more and more of a neet. I want out. I want to be alive.,2
dev_pid_4134,on the verge of tears but no real reason to cry : i know when i need to cry and until i do it just makes me anxious and awkward. i’m debating looking up sad videos so i can actually cry. it’s not even worth it to try and cheer myself up,2
dev_pid_4135,admitting to myself to the hospital tomorrow : words of encouragement please im very nervous&lt;3,2
