test_pid_1,"Im scared : This is it. I lie to myself every day and say ill make it out but i think this might just be it. 
I thought i wanted a girlfriend but i realize that what i really want is to feel loved. Ive spent 20 years on this earth but ive felt completely alone forever. My heart hurts. My subconscious taunts me every night only for me to wake up to the reality that im a loser who is not worth anyones time. 
Im scared i will live like this until the day i die.
Im being torn from the inside but im too much of coward to end it all.
Im sorry",1
test_pid_2,"New to this but just wanted to vent : I just finally realized that I’m kind of in a bad mental state. There’s this feeling of dread in me. I don’t want to work so I made an excuse not to go to work. I kind of feel like all of this stem from being financially unstable where I’m living pay check to pay check, hating my job because of the toxic environment I just had enough of it where I’m feeling like I have to walk on eggshells around people and having people talk about me because I am not at their standard, school and trying to keep up with grades and I don’t know. Just thoughts of not being here console me. I just don’t want to do anything at all I’m kind of just sad. I don’t know how to explain it. I hope someone can relate.",1
test_pid_3,"I’m sad : It’s kinda always been an issue. I wouldn’t say it’s as bad as my peers but it’s definitely bad. There’s a lot that I obviously can’t write cause it would take a while but I’ll just say the grand scheme of things. So basically I’m not really happy. I haven’t been happy. It definitely started to get really bad last year but it was always an issue growing up. I was very emotional growing up and by the time I was in 4th or 5th grade I had self esteem issues. There wasn’t much of a reason why, I just did. I didn’t like myself. Tbh I hated almost everything about myself until like middle of 7th/8th grade. I found a group of friends that I would hang out with everyday and everything felt authentic. Like we always said shit how it was and got along great. We did lie about something or start some shit with each over someone else. Like we just stuck by each other. It’s hard to explain. But they all stopped talking to me. First, one of them ended up stopping talking to me because my friend. Then the other friend just stopped wanting to hang out. It wasn’t that he wasn’t friends with us anymore, he just stayed inside all day. So it was just me and the other friend and he prioritizes school over a lot of things so basically I was alone. Like yeah I could text people but it’s not really enough. It’s not very easy for my to make new friends. I’m an introvert and honestly I’m just awkward if I don’t know you. This all happened in 10th grade. 11th grade was by far my worst year. My grandfather passed away. He was more of a father to me, as my dad wasn’t really in my life for the first 10 years. I found a girlfriend and she cheated on me. My grades were slacking causing more stress. I was alone. I had 1 close friend. There was a lot of times where I honestly wanted to kill myself. I found another girlfriend. Shes been great. We’re very close. But I still feel depressed. I’m in my senior year now. 
The whole reason why I started feeling this way was after February break. I had a lot of time to myself and I was able to reflect. A lot of the nights I smoked weed just so I didn’t have to think because I knew it wasn’t going to be well. Every vacation, whether summer, Holliday, April, February, whatever, I get really sad. I don’t smoke when I have school or if I have to do something in the morning cause the mornings are hell. So I was thinking. I realized I’m very dependent on people. I need social interaction in real life to stay happy. The issue is I’m not able to get it. Even when I do, I’m sometimes still not happy. I just don’t know what to do. About a month ago, me and my gf broke up. She wasn’t happy. I was obviously sad about it, but I was finally gonna get help for everything because as bad as it sounds, I know I need her. Without her, I genuinely don’t think I can live. She’s pretty much all I have at this point I feel like. I would never tell her this, as I don’t want her to feel trapped. 
I don’t know what to do. I can’t really bring myself to tell my mom about it. My sister was suicidal and it hurt my whole family. I just don’t want her to feel bad. I don’t want to be put on meds or something either, but I just don’t know what to do. I stayed home from school yesterday and I want to again. I have no motivation. There’s a lot more to it I just kinda wrote this up in a couple minutes. I probably forgot some important stuff but the main issue is really this paragraph. I know I have some issue. I just don’t know how to fix it, well more so I can’t bring myself to tell anyone.",1
test_pid_4,"Lonely but not alone. : All of my immediately family members is dead. My dad died 11 yrs ago and grandmother 9 yrs ago. My mom 7 months ago and grandfather a month ago. For six months, I was jobless and depressed. Now i have a job working as a service technician and i love it. But still i have episodes where i feel lonely and depressed and i miss my family but i have my fiancee and her daughter. My depression comes and goes like crazy. And makes it worse that i am still living in my mom old house for right now. But i am so scared that when i do move out that it wont be  stable to live for a long time (i am talking yrs) and that bring on my anxiety and eventually a depression period.

test_pid_5,"This year has been trash. : I dont know why I’m posting here. I don’t even know why I’m talking about it at all. In my family if you talk about your problems then you’re just attention seeking so I try not to. I guess I’m just tired of keeping it all to myself. This year I left my 4 year long abusive relationship. He raped me, he stalked me after we broke up, and harassed me relentlessly. I was scared to leave my own home. I was scared to even be *in* my own home. I was always worried that he’d show up and I spent most of my time with all of my doors locked and hiding behind the couch. I thought it would get better. Then I developed some major health problems and lost my job because of it. I loved my job. A lot. It was such a huge escape for me and it was always so fun for me to do. I had to have surgery and during that surgery i was awake the entire procedure and ever since then it’s made my mental health so much worse. The house I was trying to buy was sold, and now that I have no job who’s gonna sell me a house anyways? It’s like every time it starts looking up then it gets a million times worse. I don’t even know what to do at this point. Nothing is getting better. Everything is getting worse than I can handle and it just keeps coming. I need a break. I need something. Even if I just got my job back it would help immensely. I just want relief.",1
test_pid_6,Needed to yell into the void : I'm a pos. I'm currently also physically sick and at home with my parents. My parents really want me to work during my break from uni. I want to but at the same time I really don't. I'm too scared to even make phone calls. My social anxiety has gotten no much worse since i stopped therapy. I can do some more things but for other things my anxiety is worse. I hate applying for jobs and the rejection everytime makes me feel so fucking shitty. If I could at least work from home it would make things easier. I don't have any skills to qualify for anything. I'm still a uni student. I've been struggling with depression. I have thoughts about killing myself daily and I don't know how to ask for help. I have no friends because I distanced myself from everyone. All of this is all my fault. I'm stuck in a major I hate and I can't find a job. I'm so useless. I'm the biggest disappointment. I can't stand looking at myself in a mirror. I try to stay distracted but nothing is fun. I'm just wasting my life away doing nothing all day. I don't deserve a life. I hate uni. I hate my life. If I just killed myself it would all be over. I'm scared about what will happen if I don't succeed. I don't want my parents to get angry at me or blame themselves. I wanna have a good life but I don't think I'm even able to at this point.

test_pid_7,"I don’t know why I’m here anymore : I feel like I’m alive, solely to exist. There is no purpose to my life, I take no joy from activities, something’s may dampen my feeling for a while but then they just come back stronger. I haven’t felt normal for a long time, I forgot what normal is. I went from a confident young man with his whole life ahead of him, to someone I don’t even recognise anymore. I have crippling self doubt, anxiety through the roof, any hobbies that used to give me pleasure just don’t anymore. I hate being by myself because I have to listen to all the voices in my head. I’m a shell of the man I once was. I don’t know how much longer I can go on. I don’t want to commit suicide because it would break my family, but I wish every day for some tragic, freak accident to happen and that’ll just be it. I have a good family, good job, good friends, roof over my head and food in my fridge. I have no reason to feel like this, and yet I do. I have every minute of every day for the past 6 years.

My mom is the nicest human &amp; i know she cares for me but i've never talked about my internal struggles with her so i'm terrified how she'll react or how my family will react or might even treat me differently afterwards.
I might not be the most cheerful or happy go person but i portray a persona in front of my family. I pretend to be fine, laughing, a times cracking jokes, helping my mom with few chores etc.
I've been struggling so much for the past 3 yrs. but dealt with it alone but i'm going downhill &amp; get suicidal thoughts. The main reason i never reached out is because i never struggled with any major that might lead me to feeling like this, a severe trauma or abuse. Infact, i'm privileged to have a loving, supportive &amp; an overprotective family, food, clothes,home, a nice education &amp; way easier life than my family or people.
My family went through a lot of shit ,still do which might effect their mental health but they sort it out themselves &amp; never seek any special help. It makes me feel weak &amp; selfish for reaching out .Sometimes feeling like i'm faking it all.
I feel like such a burden &amp; disappointment to my family. A waste of space,resources, time &amp; wish i could donate my life to someone.
Even though it's getting better but where i'm from, mental illness is still looked down upon &amp; is stigmatized. Only ''mad'' or ''psychos'' seek professional help due to which people rarely ever reach out for help.
I'm exhausted of feeling like shit, of being scared of myself,of running away from my problems &amp; i wanna do something about it....

We are so broke and my husband already works very long hours. My body hurts so badly and my mind is so tired.  I have no friends left and all I have is my immediate family which consists of 3 kids and my husband.  I've been so strong for them for so long and hid this for as long as I could...I can't anymore, I just can't.   Everyday I am holding a bottle of pills in my hand.

test_pid_16,"Depressed International Student studying in Canada : In August 2019, I moved to Canada. I was initially moving to Canada with my ex-girlfriend, but a family accident happened, and she had to stay back, ultimately that resulted in a lot of stress for me. I'm 18 years old, and I'm in the last high school year, and I feel like I can't make it. I've been warned by the board multiple times because of my absences, and by teachers, most of them want me to succeed, and I can see that, but It's really hard. I had a motorcycle accident last December when I went back home for Christmas, which resulted in a significant injury in my leg, which resulted in more absences. I've paid a lot of money to move out, I moved out due to depression, but my depression is really hitting me, and I don't think I can hold it until June. I've explained in school most of my problems everyone knew about the motorcycle and a few teachers knew about my depression problems; however, it's way worse than what they think. 
I'm also a high-grade student; that's why they are so helpful, I guess too. I can't make my-self get out of bed in the morning, and I'm on the verge of getting kicked out of high school and the country since I'm an international student.

I want to stop but I need to keep doing it until my scholarship contract is ended even though I probably could not finish it.,1
test_pid_18,"Weight gain due to depression : Let me rephrase that, I’ve gained weight solely due to my own unhealthy eating. I tend to eat when I’m feeling particularly down, and I’ve felt that way for the last 5 years or so. This has led to my putting on a whopping 60 lbs in the last 5 years. It upsets me because I hate how I look, which makes my depression worse. 
I grew up in a healthy household where my Mum made nutritious meals for us. I make healthy meals at home for my husband and I, but the weight gain is due to my unhealthy snacking especially binging on potato chips and chocolate. 
I feel bad for my husband because he has to deal with this (although he has never complained), plus our sex life has really taken a hit. I’ve never been this size before and it’s really affecting me. I’ve started taking steps to help with that by limiting the amounts of unhealthy food I eat and snacking on vegetables and fruit. I would appreciate any help with making that mental switch to not relying on food for happiness. Thank you.",1
test_pid_19,"I think I'm depressed. : I'm F29, and I'm empty. And at the same time filled with fear and anxiety, and despair. I fake that I'm ok, because it helps me to not sink deeper.

I fucked up my schedule, but I don't know if it is because I'm lazy, or just dont want to start a new day no matter what, and prolong today, so tomorrow doesn't come. At least for a little bit longer.  
I have a great job and I love it. At least I loved it before, and now I just do it, because I don't want to lose it. It's the greatest place for me, the ideal place. And yet I struggle to get up and start working. I need to help my family, because I'm the only one who can, and if I loose my job, we'll plumet down to poverty again. 
My brother steals money from me. He's a grown ass man, and desperate alcoholic. I hide my wallet from him, but he still manages to grab any penny left unnatended. He is unemployed and unmotivated. I can't just leave my home - I tried. I can't leave my mother, and lonelyness makes everything 10 times worse. My dad says I shouldn't cry because he stole a couple bucks. Well, he shouldn't just shrug it off, like nothing happened, but yet he does. 
I'm an artist, but I don't make art. There's no point. I don't enjoy it as I did before. I don't enjoy video games, I don't enjoy books, movies, hobbies... I have a whole damn cupboard filled with materials to create something beautiful, and I feel they rot and turn to dust before I find the strength to use them. 
I feel like crying every time something minor goes not as I wanted or expected. Even if nothing goes wrong, I still worry and get teary, because I fear that it will. Sometimes I look at the roof of the nearest tall building and wonder, how easy it is to get up there and just end it all. Maybe the door is not locked. Maybe I only have to make a few more steps and be at peace. 
I never even get close to this building. I don't want to upset my mom. She won't make it, If I'm gone, and my family will go to ruins once again. And the worst thing, it's the only reason that keeps me breathing. The only friend I had won't talk to me, and I'm afraid she was never my friend. For all of this years.

They will blame themselves when they shouldn't. They are too good for me. It would be cruel to repay them with instanr death.
And what about my little bro? I have been his best friend all his life. A best friend dying is too crushing to put on a kid. Too traumatising. Too cruel.
Besides, I hate physical pain. Loathe it. So i'm too cowardly to even try. I don't have a gun, it's banned here. The healthcare here is too good so they might save me too fast if i try.
I thought about cutting for a bit but then i remember the fuss over that one time i accidentally cut myself and the wound bled for about 15 minutes. I went to the doctor and it was actually fine, but i had to pay so much cash for the doc to check it properly... so yea, it's too expensive. But it was still the deepest cut i have ever gotten, still have the scar. It's not my money. Shame.
So i will just rot, and wait until i die naturally. Existing but not living.

I don’t see myself past 30. 
I posted about this thought a year or so ago.  I thought I got better.  Deep down though, I still don’t. 
What kind of life is this?  What kind of world is this? The city I live in is dying.  Evil people get no consequences.  Selfishness leads to prosperity.  
The work I do is not appreciated.  I can’t cope.  I thought it was because I was new to the job but no it’s more than 6 months in now and I still can’t fucking cope.  Before the rotation I knew exactly how everything runs in every detail and now half a year in I still suck at everything.  I used to be able to speak my mind freely without any worries of people using my words against me.  Now I can’t trust people here - those I thought I could trust the most stabbed me hard behind my back.  Everything is shit. 
This is not a job I can “just quit”.  This is a small city with a very small circle of such specific profession that everyone knows everyone.  
I really don’t see no future. 
I really don’t expect myself to be able to cope every single crisis and make it to thirty. 
I can’t get myself to kill myself, I would absolutely hate to hurt my parents and my boyfriend. 
But sometimes
it’s just too tiring to carry on.

I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me, I’m so in and out of it at the same time. I still laugh but I’m not sure wether it’s genuine or not. I have these ups and downs like a seesaw while still feeling completely miserable and completely forgotten. I cut to cope. I don’t know how to describe it, but there’s an utter sense of nothing that comes back and goes away and gets worse and gets monotone, it’s never a complete up. People say that it gets better, but I really don’t think it does. We exist, we be happy and be sad and a bunch of other emotions, then we die and everyone forgets us. And really, what’s so bad about cutting? Take away the social stigma around self mutilation, and really, it’s just a way of healing yourself, mentally. 
I want to die and I can’t find a bloody reason for it. My family wouldn’t survive without me so I can’t escape, not for decades, and if I could kill myself and everyone would forget I existed, I would. There’s truly nothing I’m missing out on in life and I can’t stand to face the fact that I don’t have control over anything in my life, not even my death. I really just want to go away.

test_pid_53,"I really need some help. Any advice is really appreciated. : Quite a story here. I'm originally from Ohio - from a really religious family. After going to college, I became an atheist - and my family basically stopped really caring what happened in my life and who I was. To make matters worse, I was always so religiously sheltered growing up that I never really made many (if any) close friends. 
Well, a lot of things in life wound up with me moving to Colorado a few years back. I met a girl I really liked. She had dogs and lived with her family. She invited me to move in with them, so I did and paid her parents each week. They talked me into getting a dog, which I did about 6 months in to the relationship. I fell completely in love with the dog (Mira) and the family. 
Well, about 2.5 years into the relationship, she broke up with me (really, out of nowhere. I thought we were happy). At the same time, a seasonal job I had was just ending. Also, they were my home. So, I found myself with no friends, no adopted family, no job, no girlfriend... everything was gone. But, at least I had my dog. 
I tried to make things work, somehow, for about 3 months. But... my dog is really nervous and I can't take her to dog day cares. I also can't afford dog walkers for her, let alone even afford my own place that allows dogs. But I'm also extremely guilty when leaving her along 10+ hours each day for work... like it kills me. She is a lab, and is very attached and used to having many dogs, a backyard with a dog door, family coming and going... the works. I could tell that with me she was very depressed. 
So I moved to Ohio, where things are a little cheaper, so maybe I might make things work. As soon as I got back with Mira, I came to the realization that my family was unwilling to help me or my dog. I didn't have a place to stay, and I didn't have a job so I had no way of finding housing. I was living in my car with the dog. After a few weeks of this I had to give up. I couldn't just give my dog to a shelter, so I drove all the way back to Colorado to drop her off with my exes family in secret... and they told me they were going to get rid of her if I didn't come back to get her. 
I came back to Ohio without Mira... and have been realizing there is just nothing here for me. I have a family that just doesn't care about me, and no job prospects in my field (outdoor recreation). My friends have all moved on from when I was last in Ohio... nobody is reaching out or attempting to see me. I feel so absolutely alone, and now... now I don't have my dog, even. I reached out to my family that I was feeling extremely depressed/maybe suicidal for help.. and they told me that they didn't want me around because I was ""scaring them"". That hurt so amazingly bad.
So, I am feeling extremely alone and depressed right now. I don't really know what the right thing to do is - when I have my dog, I feel so overwhelmed/guilty leaving her, but I can't really take her to day cares. But without her, I feel - truly/stunningly alone. And if I don't go back to Colorado soon and get her... I will lose her forever.
I feel extremely depressed, but I don't see a solution or a way out of this. Does anyone have any kind of ideas for me? I need help so badly right now.",1
test_pid_54,I lost my appetite : It's crazy how bad it can get so quickly. A couple days ago I was fine and then one bad event can send me into a tailspin of anxiety and harm. I feel absolutely empty because I hurt the feelings of a bully friend by calling out their bad behavior. I know they are probably fine considering they are hanging with some other friends tonight and went out to a bar last night. I instead have barely eaten the past few days and last night I just stayed in bed after work staring at my ceiling. The fact is that this is the perfect example of me hiding my mental health for preserving friend group peace and remaining outwardly strong towards others. They accidentally found out that I didn't like them and then have been playing martyr. Inside I'm crumbling and I'm too ashamed to admit my out of proportion reaction isn't my fault and let my friends know just how physically upset I am. I feel like such a burden with my mental health during times like these. I'm sorry I can't be better.,1

With my cognition I know that there is beauty out there, but right now it just feels as if I've lost the ability to truly recognize and feel it, as if I've got some type of colourblindness. It hurts so much more because I know that I was once able to truly see it, so I am also aching because I am mourning over something I've once had. The only thing left is hope, that I will be able to get out of this again, like the times before, but everytime that hope decreases.

test_pid_56,"Just broke up with girlfriend few nights ago and I’ve been taking it really hard. It’s hard again to find motivation for anything : This is a ‘right person, wrong place’ type of situation, if that’s even a thing. I really care, love and adore this girl but her mental problems were too big of a handful for me, especially since I already have a hard enough time dealing with my own mental problems. She tried committing suicide a few weeks back and that moment was incredibly stressful and haunting for me. I felt like since that if we were to stay together, it would happen to her again at some point and I couldn’t handle that, and if we broke up it would happen again right then and there. I felt trapped. This has been a lot on my mind and I feel bad for not being able to stand by her anymore while she fights her demons, I’m still fighting my own and I feel like I can’t win my fight if I stay with her. I have worked too hard for far too long to make the progress I’ve made as far as my mental health goes. I used to be in-and-out of the behavioral hospital since an early age, and lately I have been going to the gym, getting plenty of sunlight, meditating, literally doing anything I can that I believe will make me feel better. Since we’ve broken up I thought I’d be immediately able to jump back into this and return to the goal-orientated, overachiever I know I can be; but instead I just feel grief, loneliness, regret and shame. It’s hard for me to get out of bed and get these things done. Work is the only thing that’s keeping me going right now, but as soon as that ends, I’m just back in bed with no motivation. I haven’t been able to eat and I’m already underweight so I feel like it’s taking its toll on me. All I want to do is sleep and shut out existence.

It sure doesn't feel like it. : It feels like there's no comfort or help anywhere for the pain and stress that have become constants in my life and driven me near the edge. Lately I've been hit with a deluge of, to put it mildly, unpleasant life events, and I'm left wondering how much more I can be expected to take. 
I try to find some comfort in cultivating a balanced life, but nothing seems to help. Either that, or I stumble across something that makes everything worse. A nice evening with friends leads me right back to the crushing death-spiral of depression as soon as I arrive back home to my empty flat. My work, which used to bring me pleasure or at least some measure of purpose, now feels like an insurmountable obstacle that I often can't even bring myself to face until the last minute (in some case, after the last minute). My most recent romantic dalliance since my unwanted divorce, in which he offered me flowery promises of love and a life together, ended in heartbreak before it truly began. Therapy is a temporary bandaid that prematurely gets ripped off between appointments, leaving me picking at the scabs until next time. And inpatient treatment? So I can be subjected to some superficial group therapy meetings at best and doped up on antipsychotics at worst, all while being treated as a prisoner? Forget it. So where can I realistically turn? It's a total cliche to say ""No one gets it,"" but it's true. No one who hasn't felt this way gets it. They can sympathize and try their best to understand the pain and the helplessness, but it's not something they can truly grasp.
I'm not particularly religious. In my mind as well as my heart I simply can't believe in God or an afterlife since it just doesn't make sense to me. I dearly wish I could because the people I know who do  so seem so happy, fulfilled, and hopeful. I do, however, try to find some small comfort in the rituals and prayers I grew up with, and I can't stop myself from crying out to the universe or some God to deliver me from this hell in which I've found myself. Not necessarily through death, but something has to give. Coupled with the constant, overbearing weight of depression, this onslaught of pain has just become entirely too much to bear. They say real help comes from within, but what if there's nothing inside? I have nothing to give, to myself or to this world. So what can I even do? If it truly all comes down to me, I'm doomed.",1

I’ve been feeling unmotivated in school, rarely ever having the motivation to do homework or get out of bed to go to school.
I noticed that I often used to over share so now, I rarely talk about myself to anyone, leaving myself to make a rant Twitter account. If anybody asks me about my day, I say as little as possible to stop myself from being annoying by over sharing and quickly change the topic to them. Then again, I’m not used to anyone asking me anything. People often talk about themselves around me, I just listen. If they have problems, I listen and help. But sometimes, I just want someone to talk to as well. Everybody around me is ticked off easily so I just let them do what they want I guess? When I say I have no one to talk to, I have n o  o n e.
And coming out, yes. I’m a somewhat closeted bi. I’m closeted to my family. I’m scared of coming out, I don’t know what the outcome will be.

test_pid_76,"It's not worth it. : I think about life a lot. It's hard not to think about it while aimlessly scrolling through Facebook and reacting to posts that I didn't actually like because I just wanted to please whoever shared them, walking down the street surrounded by people uncomfortably staring at me, sitting in class surrounded by so-called 'friends' of mine who openly and honestly love each other but can never really bring themselves to accept me, looking at my crush who doesn't even know I exist and is instead looking adoringly at someone else, letting out a frustrated sigh whenever anyone talks on the group chat and people start spamming it with a hundred messages a minute, and so on and so forth. So many painful reminders that I'm *supposed* to be living, *supposed* to be existing just like everyone else, that, instead, I'm just *unnatural*.
I try to force myself to feel anything. To care about what people my age usually care about. A social life, a partner, a well-paying job, a party where I could fuck some stranger and forget about them in the morning, a popular song, an Instagram account with a thousand followers, but I can't care about anything or anyone anymore. Nothing brings me happiness, sadness, or any of those normal feelings. All I feel is emptiness and anger for reasons I don't even know myself. I can't connect with people, and I always lose focus whenever someone's talking to me. I feel so alone in a noisy lecture room, and nobody stops to look at me once unless they don't have anyone else to whine and gush to. Suddenly, I become the most important person in the world just because I'm conveniently there at the right place at the right time to be used as a punching bag. 
I watch sappy romantic movies from time to time, and listen to love songs from various decades often. Sometimes I wonder to myself; will someone ever feel this way about me? Will someone ever hold me in their arms and tell me there's nowhere else they'd rather be but here with me? My parents are the only two people in the world who ever loved me. What happens when they die? Who else will love me and genuinely give a shit about me, ask whether I ate today or drank any water or changed out of my clothes? Myself? I fucking hate myself. There's no one else I'd rather see dead but me. So who else? Nobody, that's who. I might as well accept this fact right now so I don't get too shocked and upset when I find myself an old, withering human being dying alone in my cold bed. 
I'm alone in this world. I don't feel anything. I've become so apathetic that I just wanna drop out of college, pack my bags and disappear forever - if I don't kill myself first. I don't know why I still wake up in the morning, I don't know why I bother. It's not worth living for, this pathetic life of mine. **It's. Not. Worth. It.**",1

test_pid_83,"It’s my first time here but I’m afraid Im back where I started. : My depression is a really long story.  It originates from being the third girl (the first two were always best friends and there wasn’t time for me ) in the family with parents that thought I was fine and just cried a lot. 
And then the bullying in middle school for my race and the outcasting from my age group in church. 
Then my in laws who trying to convince me to get over my pregnancy losses right after they happened. 
But now I have an 8 month old son that I do everything I can do for and bring lights into my world. I thought everything would be good because I had something to live for. However, I’m expecting my second and trying to get a career at home going, and I feel just as depressed as before I became a mom. I never wanted to be back here. I thought I beat it. But I’m here crying because I feel like I don’t matter. Even though I’m expecting a child, no one asks how it’s going. No one tries to make sure we’re okay, no one asks about the exciting details even though they were excited before. I try to get my mind off of it by continuing my YouTube videos because it’s become my passion. But I want to share my passion and yet the fact that I share my content and no one subscribes makes me feel so important. I know subs don’t happen right away but it’s the fact that I work hard (and it’s Disney!) and trying to hard to put in the effort for something I really care about and no one cares. 
No one cares. 
It’s killing me. I feel like my own doctor doesn’t care and she used to treat me like we were actually friends. Everyone I think of in my life that should know what’s going on with my depression, I know will downplay what I’m feeling or just say to pray it out and I’ll feel better. It won’t make me feel better.  I want someone to understand that. I don’t know how to feel like I matter again. I hate thinking that the world wouldn’t change if I died but it’s feeling normal again. I’m starting to not care about gaining weight again and I was gaining a good amount before (I was proud of it but literally no one else was; I’m underweight). I don’t know what to think anymore.

test_pid_95,"Last night on Earth: this time I dont have any hope for tomorrow : Since the very first time I first started to understand people, friends, life, I have had this fear that my life would end in a suicide. Whether it was class 10th my first failed relationship, a time following which for two years I could not think of anything but jumping off the first floor of my house. I have played the scene in the back of my mind for so many times that I know exactly how much second it would take, the leaves I will be touching on my way down or the exact set of stones I would have my head banged against. It was also then I almost gave the idea of finding a person who would trust me with all their self and confide in me their truest and purest version. 
But it happened I did find love and I did find a person who loved me all their heart. At this time, those years, I felt less suicidal than ever. It was an era of dreams, having passions. But, even it wasnt as crystal perfect as it sounds, nothing is. I somehow knew that even this would end, I cant be that lucky. And end it did after exactly 3 summers. I again became back to having suicidal thoughts, this time it was mostly dreams of being drowned in lakes, oceans, anywhere with water.
It took a month I again fell in love and this person knew whatever I was going through better than anyone and stayed so for the next three winters. I had suicidal thoughts here and there but the person was really nice to many and kept care of my dark days. Even with this I knew at the back of my head that this could end as I kept breaking her spirit unciouscly, now that today she is gone I have no more reason to live, no more reasons to evade suicidal thoughts.

test_pid_104,"I hope I can post this here. My wife has severe depression. And it's effecting both of our lives very heavily. What can I do to help? : So. Let me just say I've been around this my whole life. My mother had severe depression. And other mental health issues. I also developed a little bit of depression in my high school years. Which was due to my father and stepmother who were drug addicted narcissist. Since graduating and moving away I've been so positive and had a great look on life. 
But .. my wife has got it and she's got it bad. We met when we were both depressed in high school about our family situations. So when we graduated. We jumped in my car and left. Moved 500+ miles away. Lived with family and were having much more fun. She was still slightly depressed then. But she was a lot happier. 
The turning point was when we got pregnant with our daughter. We both always wanted kids. We wanted the family life so we could have our own family and raise our kids better than our parents did us. But.. that all changed when it actually happened. My wife begged to have a baby young. I was a little reluctant because I knew the price that's paid. I grew up raising my siblings (think Fiona in shameless). I knew what it was like to care for others every single need. And I warned her of this. But of course I wanted a family too. So we agreed and it happened. 
That's when everything went South. Litterally. We moved back south near her family. And had our daughter. The entire pregnancy was a depressed nightmare for my wife. She was stuck home while I worked full time. And she resented me for it. I even changed jobs to try and work night shift so I was home during the day and she had the 1 car we had. That didn't work. She would keep me up all day and not let me sleep. I was running on 4 hours of sleep a day. For MONTHS. Then our daughter was born and she was overwhelmed. She never experienced adult life and instead of taking it head on. She shied away. And relied heavily on me to take care of all the ""adult"" stuff. I worked, cooked, cleaned, made Dr appts, went to Dr appts, came home early from work if there was any issues. I had to stop suicide attempts multiple times. Ive had to fight knives away from her multiple times. 
I ended up losing my job that year because of it. After that we bounced around job to job. House to house. Like crazy. 
And now. We're restarting all over again. We found a very cheap house to rent. I'm at a new job. Things have finally settled down again since our daughter was born. But. The depression is still there. She's better in the sense that she's better at talking to people. She's not so afraid to make phone calls anymore. And go to the doctor alone. She's still afraid to drive long distances though. And she still has no friends. So she sits at home while I work. And she just gets depressed over and over again every single day. Then when I get home I have to scramble to pick up the pieces. 
If you step back and look at our life. We should be HAPPY. We have a place. A beautiful daughter. A dog. 2 cars now! There's food, tv, Netflix. We have a yard. We live close by to some good shopping and parks. We are doing GREAT for a couple 20 year olds. 
But she doesn't see it. She sees all her old friends on Instagram and Facebook living the college life. Having fun still like in high school. And she gets hateful of her own life and her own circumstances. She wants friends, And money, and a job. But she doesnt have any of those. And she gets super depressed about it. And she turns that anger towards me when I'm home. And takes out her anger on me like it's my fault. Saying if she never met me she'd be happy and be having fun. 
I told her. She has her own car now. PLEASE go out and do SOMETHING during the day to keep her mind out of the gutters. Go out and meet people! Go see an old friend! Do SOMETHING. But all she has for me are excuses. Of why she can't or how she's afraid to. 
I just want to figure out how to help her. She refused medication. She doesn't like it. Also she's horrible at remembering to take it. 
What can I do? Cause we should be enjoying life right now. But instead it's like I have the whole world on my shoulders. And she's just trying to jump out the window of a moving train on a daily basis. 
What can I do for her? Please. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for reading",1

test_pid_108,"I have not been doing good at all : Last semester-college- I failed three classes, partially due to illness. I know this wasnt my fault but this semester, my anxiety and depression have me terrified of everything and every little mark  it has also had me sick, and scared to go to class. 
This basically means that I can be in one of three states:
1. Overly energetic
Normally this is right after I get a mark, but can be just a 'good' day. I often am somewhat productive, but have a bad habit of putting things off as I feel like I have all the time in the world like this.
2. Extream Anxiety 
This normally happens as I try to do something, mainly bigger projects that I think I have a handle on then suddenly dont or remembering my struggle in one class. 
3. I want to Cry myself to sleep
I get so exaughsted and mucky minded I just want to sleep  for the rest of time. I doubt want everything to end, I just want to sleep forever. I can hardly do anything in this state and what I do is slow and tedious. 
I know I have anxiety and depression, and I kno part of why I have been like this. My Aunt can be a bitch. She basically said that it was because I missed class and gets it in my mind that I have to constantly been in class for any good grades. So that combined with my already low tolerance for knowing when I should talk to someone, my inability to open up to people, my slight distrust of the mental health capabilities of my curent location-its Canada but I have had issues, mainly with being brushed off- and my need for good grades, I hav really been struggling with my mental health.  
And it's not just my mental health, its physical. I think I have something of a bug but I cant bring myself to do anything about it. Like above I need to be in class, I cant afford to miss any class. I know it's bad, but I cant breack it.  I just, I hate it. I hate my curent health level and it scares me. I have been in a state of anxiety recently and just cant breack it.

test_pid_109,"I don’t know what to do : This all started when I moved away from my kids to go from by for a better job
It’s been all down hill from there 
Me and my wife moved from Vermont where my kids and ex are to Florida where me and my have had a child. 
Everything was fine until the promotion was too much stress and draining me of my will to live so I quit and kept bouncing around till I landed back at my original point of employment minus the promotion. It is important to mention at this time I had an emotional affair with a co worker which I now regret to the fullest extent and honestly might be a big part of why my depression is getting so bad. I never said I was a saint in life. Had to start all over so naturally bills started piling up. That was when we found out we were having a baby. In all the excitement it let me forget about everything that was slowly turning upside down in my life. A year and a half later my oldest sister gave me the Christmas gift of paying a retainer for a lawyer so me and my wife could file bankruptcy and start over. Things were good again I was back in a management position at a large retailer again making ok money. Then after the bankruptcy I was told to step down due to performance at work so my income went down again but this time I got a second job. Never saw my family much but I was paying the bills so to me it felt alright. But then I got involved in a child custody case with my ex due to her drug use and disappearing on the kids for a week while they were her ex’s mother. That lasted about five months and ended up losing the case mostly due to me living so far away and that I hadn’t seen my kids that much since I had left even though I kept strong communication with them. So I lost. All through the he court process I lost an uncle to cancer and also found out my estranged father was dying. I hadn’t talked to because I shut him out of my life with no real reason besides that my mom really was bothered by him and me having any kind of relationship. Things started looking up when I got another chance to move up at work but that ultimately didn’t work out and I’ve had to step down once again. Now we’re struggling financially and emotionally and I feel like I am to blame for everything because I am. It’s my fault that we’re in this mess again, it’s my fault we’re getting behind on bills again, I constantly fight with my wife and they always consist of her saying she wants a divorce because she’s miserable. I don’t know what to do. I’m toxic to everyone around me and I mess up everything. I’m a failure in everything I do. I destroy everything I’m apart of. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I sometimes wish that I would just have an accident or something so I don’t have to keep letting everyone I love down and driving my wife who I love so so much away. I don’t do anything I only leave the house for work and that’s it. I’m a type 1 diabetic and I haven’t seen a doctor in almost two years.

Ive dated a bunch of people but I have never experienced an emotion like this. Still to this day I think about him a lot, and the feeling hasn’t subsided at all. I dont really know what to do at this point. Its been years and I still feel the same. 
This morning I saw that he was celebrating his 1-yr anniversary with his new significant other, and it kinda ruined the entire day for me. Everything got really heavy, and it felt like I was experiencing an anxiety attack. I was drowning in a bunch of thoughts such as, “That could have been me” or “what if that was me?”
Ive never felt this way before. Is this love, or am I a fool? And what am I supposed to do? Will I even ever love like this again? Is this emotion even REAL?",1

test_pid_116,"my entire life is crumbling apart : this is a long post, with a shit ton of back story and references to trauma, abuse, infidelity, substance abuse, suicide. 
My life has steadily been collapsing since I met my abuser in 2013. I stayed with him for three years, through severe financial, sexual, mental, and physical abuse. He just absolutely destroyed my ability to trust, my sense of safety, and devastated my relationships with my friends and family by isolating me and disrespecting them. When I left in 2016, I petitioned for and was granted a protective order for the maximum term allowed by law - 3 years. I've had vivid night terrors since I left that typically involve my abuser getting into my home, or slaughtering someone I love. I started seeing a therapist and was diagnosed with C-PTSD, MDD, and Panic Disorder. 
In end of 2017, I began dating a guy we'll call Sam. Sam seemed super kind, caring, just an overall great person. We'd known each other since 2011, but our relationship still felt new and exciting!  
Unfortunately, I found out in October that Sam had cheated on me several times over the \~2 years we'd dated by then. He slept with someone else several times, had nudes of another woman, and emotionally cheated with a third that we'll call Sarah. 
Sam would text Sarah every day all day. He'd ask her to dinner, take her to coffee, he took her to a wedding. Drove her everywhere. Introduced her to his son, even. Constantly complimented her body, and would refer to her as ""Pretty girl"" every day. I was upset about the woman he'd slept with, but his relationship with Sarah was devastating. 
He promised not to see her or talk to her anymore, but I found out through mutual friends that they were still hanging out. She and I ended up in a confrontation over text, in which she said very hateful things about my relationship, which felt like she'd heard from Sam. She continually messaged me dogging on me and my relationship until I blocked her shortly after xmas. Things were okay for a few weeks.
Fast forward to end of January. One of my very close friends committed suicide. This was overwhelming, especially because he'd reached out to me two days before it happened, and I told him I was too depressed to really talk. 
When I went home for the funeral, I stayed with Sam. He received emails from Sarah that someone was harassing her online, and she believed it was me. It culminated on the day of my friend's funeral that Sarah showed up to Sam's with her father (no we are not teenagers, she is 35 and lives with her parents). She demanded that I speak to her, yelled at me, called me obscene names, and begged me to ""hit her so she could have my ass thrown in jail"". I was already drunk on two bottles of wine, and in NO state to handle anything, so I just kept repeating that she needed to leave and I had no interest in talking to her. 
Sam took her side and told her she didnt have to leave. She then asked me if ""we we're even dating."" When i said we had been for two years, she freaked out on Sam. Apparently, he'd told her that I was a stalker, he didnt really know me, and I was only at his house because he was afraid Id kill myself. She left after blowing up on him, and he just went back to working on his computer in the next room. Part of me feels like HE is the one that messaged her online and created the entire blowup. 
I was absolutely devastated. My friend's suicide, my relationship with Sam, Sarah's outbursts. It was too much. I took a box cutter off the shelf and sliced open my arm, then downed the rest of my citalopram. (6 pills of 40 MG)
Since that night, I've (halfway) broken things off with Sam. Even though we still talk and hang out and everything. i feel like im just stuck in another cycle and im ashamed and just feel pathetic for allowing him to stick around. I drink 1-2 bottles of wine or most of a bottle of vodka each night. I dont eat. I still cant sleep because of night terrors. I cant afford therapy anymore so I just switched my meds to see if that helps. My entire life feels pointless and painful and I'm honestly just exhausted by everything. I have no idea how to move forward or if I even want to. Idk. I don't really even know if I want advice or to just be able to admit that I want to die without being locked away in a hospital and losing my job while still feeling fucking awful.",1

test_pid_118,"A rant : I feel really guilty for posting on here because I feel that I don't have a reason to be feel like this, but I really need to just put down my thoughts.
Anyway, let me just describe my situation. My family is in the middle class, so I've always had a comfortable life. I've always gotten good grades at school, though I had to skip 1st and 2nd grade due to certain circumstances. Currently in high school, with my favorite areas of study being math. I was involved in combat sports, which I enjoyed and participated in competitions. I started playing piano about 6 years ago, though I've quit a lot along the way and I haven't made much progress. I also enjoyed singing, though I never had a coach.
So, probably seems like a pretty perfect life? Happy family, only child, a model student, etc. Yeah, I try to think so too. But I feel weird, I feel as if I'm not good at anything. I am stupid, ugly, untalented, mediocre, etc. I hate myself. I hate my looks. I try to continue my old hobbies, but I feel that I'm never going to be great. I want to do math as a career but I'm demolished by my own thoughts that state that I'll never be remembered and that I'll live my life in vain. I've looked at high places and wondered what would happen if I was gone, if anybody would care or notice. I've come close to s*** h***. I was thinking of doing pro sports, but then I remembered that there are so many people who are younger than me and are more set to get Olympic goal than I'll ever be. I want to sing, play the piano, make music for many to hear,but then I hear my voice and that idea goes down the drain. I feel like because I'm the only child that ill disappoint my parents. I don't know what to think or how to describe it, but that's my attempt. I hope you guys will understand. Thank you, and I guess goodbye.",1
test_pid_119,"I don't see any point being here. : I'm not going to kill myself, so don't worry about that.
It's just that I don't see any point in me existing. Whenever I look at my peers, they're always happy, have an abundance of friends with them and have this aura of confidence and charisma that attracts anyone. For me, it's the direct opposite; I have a limited amount of friends (or acquaintances more likely), I don't feel happy most of the time and have 0 charisma. Granted, I'm watching videos on how to gain charisma and be more likeable but the progress of it is very gradual. And added with my family and the dynamics of it being fucked up, slogging through college for a degree that I both don't want and not good at (even if I eventually cared about it) and not feeling happy, I shouldn't be here. I honestly feel that I'm taking someone's space in college and they would be better privileged to have it rather than me.

I’m 17 and don’t really know what to do with myself since a long time.
It seems like happiness is not part of my life and I force myself to smile whenever I need to, but once I turn my head, every thing fades away and I’m back being sad.
I first thought this was gonna last for some time, you know when you’re a teenager everything seems bad, but it’s lasting something like a year.
But speaking about me, I think that it never actually started because it was always like that.
I remember when I was something around 8, my mother told me : ""Why don’t you ever smile ?""
This stuck with me, knowing that my mother is really supportive and really want me to be happy.
I keep bringing myself down every time for any thing I do. It’s like I can’t be satisfied with something I make or think.
I’m not strong enough to talk about that to someone. I don’t know why, but I just can’t explain my feelings to somebody else. Perhaps I’m afraid to embarrass them ?
But in the same time, I hope someone goes through the mask I wear every day, and understand my true feelings...
But for now, I don’t know what to do any more.
Now my only hope is that maybe time will solve everything and it’ll just be a bad memory.
It may not be the good subreddit for my problems, because there are so many people suffering things that are way worse than me...

I am 32M, currently doing PhD. I will be out of fellowship next month and it's still a year before I finish my PhD. I have been suicidal in my school days, tried once but no one knows.
I have these thoughts again and again when I see my future going no where. I have a huge stage phobia of addressing any gathering or even having anyone's attention on me. This thing is hurting me most as in my PhD and in future I have to address audience (students) as I want to be a professor and I really enjoy explaining things to other but only one on one or to a small familiar non judgemental audience. Everytime before my half early PhD presentation I get in to a depressed stage and I feel like I run somewhere and be in isolation. 
Before my first PhD presentation I was under huge mental stress and it got me diabetes insipidus (I think it was due to stress). I do not like sharing these thoughts with anyone and it's the first time I am sharing it to anyone. I think sharing this will not help me and people will just pretend they care but no one actually cares. I think I don't have the capability to survive financially or emotionally. I like being alone, living alone.
On personal front I have a girlfriend and our marriage is fixed later in this year. We have been together since 10+ years but I feel I am ruining her life too. She is very confident, well spoken in front of anyone but she is stuck with me.
The reason why I don't share these thoughts is because I have done nothing to solve these issue. I am a lazy person and just want to lay in bed surfing net playing games. I know I can be better but I don't make any effort. Also I am not brave enough for a suicide and I just wish someday I vanish from this world or better vanish from everyone's life like I never existed.",1

test_pid_160,"My sad fucking life : (English is not my first language, sorry)
I grew up in a conservative Catholic Family, I love my Mum, Dad, my Brother and sister. From the beginning, I always had to pass the standard set by my parents which is good grades, behaviour, attitude, helping house chores. I was happy with all of this and it is the same reason I developed a sick mindset that ""If someone passes you, you're not good enough"" and through out elementary, I never got to enjoy playing around with other kids. I was always ""focused"" on studies and because I was a loner I became anti-social. I hated people, despised others, always have frown on my face and its just shit. 
When I went to 1st year of Highschool (Grade 7 here in asia) I was a bookworm, a very agressive person. But it changed when I converted to Islam (not gonna get into that but yeah, Im the only muslim in my family). It was going good, until my family started questioning me about my belief and scaring me that Muslims are terrorist (hahaha If I was a terrorist, I would have left a long time ago). Eventually it set off a chain of events that haunts me everyday because of this I left home, I skipped school because of all this drama. I guess Im heartless now, Im scared to open up to people around me. Im distant with everyone in my family, I dont care as much with my school. It's the memories, always stuck in my head. Waking me up at 3 in the morning reminding me of all the shit that happened in the past, all the painful words, all the anger and hatred. Making me want to just end it. Im not truly accepted in my family because of my different ""faith"". Im sorrounded by toxic people at school. Its just a cycle. I'd be like this for days then it will go away.

I long to do something meaningful with my life, and to be successful, and consistently happy and it angers me the longer I go without doing so, but it’s like I’m possessed by something that wants nothing more than to push me the other direction, a voice nagging at me to stay in bed all day and isolate myself from everyone.

test_pid_162,"Suggestions Please : 
I feel like I have little to no ability to form insight about myself and my behaviours. The easiest way to describe it is like how a zombie feels: Nothing, right? It only knows to seek out brains but it doesn’t know how or why. I think that’s a good description of me, except instead of brains I’m looking for a job and attending school and trying to maintain personal relationships, the way people do. I don’t know why or how, I just have an innate ability to do it so I continue to function, like an automated human. I’m not an especially good or talented automaton, but people that I think I care about continue to remain in my life so I must be doing reasonably okay. I can’t describe it super well but I feel like my personality is a shell and I just react to stimulus like an insect would if it were met with a predator or obstacle. There doesn’t seem to be any inner thought process going on that I can identify when I interact with other people. Whatever part of my brain that takes control when I’m placed in a situation where I have to socialize seems to do an okay job, as I can usually maintain small talk and make the right facial gestures and whatnot. I’m certainly a human, that much is obvious when I look in a mirror, but I don’t feel like a person. Or maybe I do. I don’t know what that is. 
I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD by my doctor and I take a stimulant medication for it, and it helps, but even the ability to maintain focus doesn’t seem to help me gather how I feel on a day to day basis and form a general consensus type thing about what is wrong with me.

test_pid_168,"The World Changed When I Got Depressed : So we grow up thinking and learning that the world doesn't change just because we get sick or run into problems. The world goes around as normal we are led to believe. 
But in my case, there's been one thing that has completely changed, since my life started to go wrong. It's how people respond to me now that I'm lost and depressed as opposed to vibrant and well put together.
I have a high education and have been working for years in my field. It has always given me a sense of stability to have my wits acknowledged and to able to connect to people easily and find the good in things. I lived in a fancy apartment in a very good neighbourhood. If I had to make a phone call to someone about something back then, it'd be with enthusiasm and about some minor detail, like arranging a birthday party or getting a vaccine for my kid etc. Every communication that I had with people was pleasant or non dramatic. I didn't have a reason to contact anyone to solve my problems. 
Well, the relationship fell apart. I'm the one who had to move out. I never found a place to rent or buy after that. It's been 5 years now. I've been renting many places for short periods, as this has been all I've able to find. My mental health has been going downwards for every year that has passed me by, without a place to call my own. I've had to call everyone and everything to fix my problems ever since. It's been one thing after the other, because of the domino effect. I *can't* find a place, so that adds major stress, I have to store all my stuff with family and with storage services, find a place to keep my address, figure out how to deal with that in conjuction to the fact that I have a kid with my ex and I can't just move my address far away without getting into trouble over it. I'm just floating around out here, like a balloon. I wonder when I'll completely float away. Life took a turn and *everything* changed. It's a nightmare and I'm performing miracles everyday just to make it into the next day, but the problems keep piling up and the people, the way they respond to me now.. 
I've found that *everybody* in my social circle is either a stranger now or apathetic towards my situation. I have no adults to lean on and everybody puts this extra distance or contempt towards me. I've had no help. I've really discovered society as a cold place that has just laughed in my face when I needed it the most. I feel used by society and thrown away like garbage. Every time that I've had to explain my ordeal to the municipality office or a doctor etc., they've talked to me like I'm stupid after learning that I'm stressed and depressed. It somehow takes away my credibility as a person that I've become depressed. Everyone speaks to me in a baby voice and I just almost reject the world for what it has become to me. Now I'm just shattered into bits and pieces mentally and can't even find a beginning or an end to this mess. It certainly feels like the dark night of the soul, but more than that it feels like the world changed when I changed.",1

i have depression, mostly social anxiety and I’m bulimic.
recently though after not drinking caffeine for months i drank like 8 cups of coffee at once for fun. the main thing im noticing is that i feel a lot happier and have wayy more motivation to do things. like, i just cleaned my whole room, i dont feel anxious or like im wasting my day, and i havent thrown up today at all. i have more energy though its probably because i actually feel motivated to do something and less depressed.
i know coffee suppresses your appetite so thats probably helping me not overeat which is what triggers my bulimia/throwing up.

I think I always subconsiously knew I was never going to make the grades and stay there and I think thats where my depressed thoughts began. A few of my friends also got kicked out of that school and all went to a different one (the same one as each other). I, however, was forced by my parents to go to a different school, where I knew nobody and had to do A-levels that I didnt want to do in the first place. I dont blame my parents as they were trying to get me the best opportunity. But me being already quite nervous in social situations, struggled to make friends in the first couple of weeks. This huge knock in confidence has caused me to become even more nervous, and I have developed a nervous tick where I bite the insides of my cheeks. Im currently in my final year of school, where i sit alone and have done for almost 2 years. Last year i used to go on walks on my own during frees and lunch, to spare the embarrassment of being alone all of the time, however i have stopped caring and instead i just sit on my own. My grades are very bad as well, i can never be bothered to do any of my work, even when deadlines are approaching fast. I have even recently started to self harm, where i punch myself in the leg as hard as i can. Although i havent done this in a few months now, im not opposed to doing it again.

test_pid_185,"Senior Year Sucks : Sorry for the long post. I graduate in 3 months and I am anxious. My high school ""experience"" has been pretty crappy. I play football and I wrestle. Or used to I guess. Going into my senior year I thought it would be the best year by far especially because junior year was so rough, I went through allot of anxiety and depression that year. 
The start of summer made me think that everything was uphill from there and I had started my first job at Walmart and my supervisors all talked to my mom about how I was one of the best workers they've had in a while (my mom works there too) and football camp was great, I thought I had a chance to at the very least start on special teams (It was only my second year). I was talking to allot of people and hung out with my friends almost daily. I was doing pretty good. 
Then one day I was driving to work in my grandpa's truck when I got in a car accident. The worst part is how it happened. No rain or wet roads, No fog, No animals in the road, No other cars on the road, literally the most ideal driving conditions ever. I fucking rolled it. I had just gotten my paycheck and it was blowing around in my car because I had the windows down and  I was distracted trying to save it from blowing out the window and I went off the shoulder of the road, freaked out, over corrected and rolled onto the road.
Luckily I came out with nothing but a broken hand. But that was enough to make me lose my job at Walmart and I couldn't participate in practice anymore obviously. Also I have a would-be badass scar on my hand but every time I look at it I just remember how dumb I am. I stopped seeing my friends everyday and didn't even want to go to camp anymore because it just sucked not playing. The county fair came around right before school started and that was fun. I saw my friends again and showed countless people my hand and told them what happened which sucked.
School started and once again I told countless people the most embarrassing story of my entire life. The doctor said I would be cleared for practice about 3 weeks into the season so my hope for football kinda dropped from there. It was nice to see friends daily again but everyday sucked. I was depressed again and was always in my head. 
After I was cleared I didn't play all that much so when football ended I didn't care at the time. All that mattered to me was wrestling. We had a new coach who was probably the polar opposite to our last one who became the assistant coach. He had wrestled in college and was something of a wrestling legend in his hometown so we all wanted to make him proud.
The wrestling season went better. I was wrestling 132 and actually seeing myself in shape and 7% body fat made me feel so much better. I loved wrestling and it helped me not be depressed. I also got a therapist which helped a ton. I actually was pretty happy. The biggest downer was that I only won one match (It was my 3rd year). about three weeks until the end of the season the assistant coach tells me that I was ineligible and I tried to get my grade up but every time I'd get one up, another would drop. I eventually got kicked off the team right before regional which sucks.
Which brings us to now. I miss football and wrestling so much. They're all I think about, and I'm never going to do either again. During wrestling season I'd go to bed and imagine me winning a match and it would help me sleep. During football season I imagined making some play or doing literally anything and it just made me so hopeful that something would happen. Here I am now, 3 career wins in 3 wrestling seasons and no stats in 2 seasons of football. I wish I could go back in time and change everything but I can't. I feel depressed and anxious constantly. And on top of all of this I graduate soon and will probably never see allot of my friends again. And there's so much more but I already typed a whole novel. Maybe the next couple months will be different but I don't know. I feel like every time I get ahead or am happy some big stupid bull crap ruins it.",1

Liquid thoughts run through my mind. 
I've felt them flow to find their delta, 
and pool into the conscious tide
which smooths the pebbles of my mineral memory. 
On the cloudy peaks of my perception, 
they precipitate, incepting streams
which etch the slate of my meandering soul. 
Intangeable, the force by which they fall
it calls their steady trickle through the troughs 
carved by thoughts that came before.
Liquid thoughts, i've felt them dig their trenches, 
i've felt their saline currents flow through the scars in my soul and into a restless sea, 
waves now crash and crush my brittle memories. 
Glaciers crowd my clouded peaks and frost my feelings, a flood of which my banks could not afford. 
In fear to let them thaw, I patient, and grow numb, my sonder raw. 
More intangeable than ever the force endures. 
Insatiable, it lures my landscape into winter,
but the climate of my broken soul is all but seasonal
as now, these liquid thoughts, they run my mind.

The only thing I've never lost interest in is music, but the process of recording is so overwhelming, even though I've been playing my instrument for years and I'm quite good at it. I'm worried that this will make me lose interest in recording any of the things I've written over the years, to never be released to the world.

test_pid_204,"The endless cycle : Hi guys,
I'm usually one that suffers in silence but i got some news today that actually makes me need a hug. Since I don't have anyone but cats, thought this might help.
The short story is I found out today that at 32, I have kidney disease. I'm not really surprised since 1) I've been an energy drink addict for over a decade 2) I hardly drink water and 3) my gma died from kidney failure. It's like the devil's triangle for kidney failure.
I think I'm finally seeing that I'm not invisible anymore. Like, growing up I never had any health problems. Yeah I was chubby but healthy. I turn 32 and I'm basically falling apart. Kidneys are shit, my eyes are getting worse, my weight is a joke, and my depression has gotten worse. Like wtf is up with this getting old shit. 
Of course there are ways to make this not as big of a deal as I'm thinking it is. The info I got was of course drink a ton of water and be healthy. Easy to say, hard to do.  
Do any of you manage to do things that your depression would normally stop you from doing? how do you get over that hump and ignore the demon?",1

I got happy, since I've never had someone that's a girl who started to talk to me before.
We talked irl, and then I decided I wanted to text her. I never had the courage to do so, but I thought it would be worth it.
We talked a lot, and she said it was nice talking to me.
I was of course really happy.
After a while, I noticed that she stopped talking to me irl. And I'm so shy that I'm still nervous to start a conversation with her irl, and I hate myself for that, but that's another story.
After that, I noticed that I was the only one who started conversations through texting, and she always responded in a really cold way (cool, nice, huh.)
I did a little experiment and waited for her to talk to me instead of me talking to her, just to see if she valued our friendship.
She hasn't talked to me in a month.
I guess I disappointed her. She expected more from me, she expected someone interesting and mysterious, but she got disappointed.
That's all I've been really, a disappointment to other people.",1

I love night, everything is quiet and calm, nobody is around; but sleep, sleeping is my number one fear because I know that every day I will have to let my mind run unhinged for hours until I fall asleep, if I'm lucky.

I work on Friday, so we would both be able to watch the baby without having to pay daycare BS fee. We're both really depressed so our memories aren't the sharpest and we're actually forgetting to pay our bills on time. So unfortunately, we're getting bills with late fees and such and starting to add up since our income is pretty spread thin as is. Well there was a bill we forgot and there was a late fee on it. He comes home and yells at me about me knowing where the bill is or when it was due. I told him I put the bill right on the table for him to see it (which he never really sits at the table to consitute a good spot to put something important in view). 
He raised the volume of his voice when I explained to him where I put the bill at and he kicked the table out of spite. Then he yelled again ""the fuck you did!"". He took the bill and went to the office to pay it and slammed the door behind him. He was gone for awhile but came back sitting in his car for a long time. During all this, the baby was crying and I was trying to calm it down. As I was holding him and I was crying so hard myself, my eyes were flooded with tears. I didn't want to be there anymore, I felt like a piece of me had died and died a long time ago since I've been with him.
My heart is so broken and I just want to die. I can't because of my little potato.. I don't want to lose him. It's really hard because I feel like I'm anchored to this bullshit relationship because having a baby with the asshole. And yes, we're married (yes traditional morals), and I don't want my potato to grow up without a father. But at the same time I don't want him to end being like how my husband grew up with his.
I'm so stuck I don't know what to do. I want to run away and take my potato with to me. He doesn't deserve this.. and neither do I. My heart is so broken.
We separated back in 2016, and he suckered me with his cries of missing me and acting like he felt bad not appreciating the things I've done for him. I was always there for him and he basically threw my kindness to the ground and drowned in the mud of manipulation. I'm such a push over and too sympathetic, falling for it all over again and he falls right back into his narcissistic behavior. Everything is always about him.. he's the victim, he's the smart one, he's the good guy never did anything wrong. I can't remember the last time he actually apologized for the bullshit he's done to me

I’m still struggling with being so dependent on weed but I’ve been doing other things to help escape this cycle. 
I started giving myself a chunk of time after work that I can’t sit down and watch tv/play games. Then I started trying to find things to keep me occupied. I’ve been going to the gym and doing cardio and I go about 3x a week for a month now. 12x in a month is better than none! I’ve been drinking less sodas and looking at ways to eat a little better. 
Basically I’m taking little steps in the right direction and not punishing myself for my struggles. Instead of giving up entirely cause I’m struggling with sobriety I’m finding positive ways to counteract it.

I’m gay anyway. 
I don’t even know if I have depression. I’ve never seen a psychiatrist. All I know is that I’m so fucking bored, even when life is going perfect on paper, and, if I can’t even get to a mid level college, why should I bother? I’ve always thought that I was destined to be a sob story. Imagined I’d be an early death. I dreamt of cars sneaking up behind me on the daily route back home, the red I’d inevitably see as I crash forward and crack my head on the pavement, the rest of my bones shattered on impact. I dreamt of late night shootings, slippery feet on ladders, and any slight increase of clumsiness as I walk past a cliff. Every day I see another version of myself die. I’m just wondering when it’ll be me. 
If anything, I’d assume I would be diagnosed with pessimism. It’s not like I’m incapable of being happy. I don’t bring depression with me everywhere I go, but it always stands behind to catch me when I fall. 
what am I saying in this post????
tl;dr: I don’t think I have depression but I have depressive tendencies, and, I don’t know what to do about it? Therapy won’t be an option for another 6 months and I don’t see how else I might get better. If I even should. Death would be nicer. Maybe I have dysthymia. Who ducking knows.",1

test_pid_257,"Here it comes... : Im slowly starting to distance myself from people more and more. Even when my heart is yearning for someone to listen to me I don’t even try to search my msssages for someone who might respond. This part really sucks. The part where you feel an episode coming and you start to surrender from it. How can I not feel at all but hurt so bad at the same time? My favorite time of day is when it is over and I’m laying in my bed at night. I can just be depressed freely without having to pretend that I’m happy. The day is so exhausting. Forced laughs and small talk. Especially the business I am in... I have to constantly talk to people and be friendly and I really just want to look them in the eye and say “I really just want to go home and lay in bed and not exist for as long as I want.” That’s why nighttime is my favorite time of day. If I can cry that day, then I will cry and soak my pillow with my tears. I can pick at my skin without people starting at me rip the skin off of my fingers or scratching my face. I just want to feel better. I just want to wake up in the morning and feel better. 
Depression exhausts not only your heart and mind but your body too. I am so tired... I just want to sleep for a week and I still don’t think it would be enough. I’m constantly yawning falling asleep on the couch after work watching a TV show with my parents. I remember when I used to smoke blunts with my friends and have a great time but now I’m usually the one who gets high and passes out before 10. Oh and my stomach...Nauseo, Diarrhea, Cramps. Going days without eating because you’re scared you might throw it all up in the middle of your work day. And when you have depression and don’t eat for that long, you start to feel your body deteriorate. Your muscles ache and your head hurts. Either way, I am in pain. I can’t win when it comes to my stomach...

Let me begin with my background. Last summer I became really depressed. I felt like such a burden on everyone and was so unhappy with myself and life. I knew this was really bad depression and got out of it and it’s something I never want to experience again. It really scares me looking back at it
A little bit about me. I’ve always been a very driven and motivated person. Always see the bright side of things and don’t complain about things. I try and be positive and focus a lot on self development and being the best dude I can be. 
Every since I got back from my deployment in October my sleep started becoming irregular. I started becoming tired all day long. I go to bed around 8 and wake up at 6:30 and struggle to Get out of bed still. I’ve been trying to force myself to stay up till 9 or 9:30 or wake up earlier to meet 8 hours of sleep no more and no less like I used to. Even if I get 8 I’m still tired all day. I eat super healthy and exercise regularly. I’ve also become tired of people. I go everywhere by myself now. If I can have a day completely to myself it’ll be the best day I’ve had in awhile. I’m starting to think this being tired and sleeping so much might be a symptom of depression. Not really sure what to do. Thoughts?",1

She asked for a face pic, which is common on those so you can put a face to who you’re talking to. I sent it, and she says, and I quote “I’m going swimming talk later” with no punctuation and I immediately got the notification that she removed me as a friend.
You’re not always gonna mesh with someone, but when you’re just looking for friends and then immediately drop it like that, really makes me feel bad.

Yet I feel so so so so bad. Some days will be good. Other days will be terrible. Sometimes I think I beat it but my everyday habits are still terrible: eating too much or way too little, can’t sleep easily, barely motivated to do anything, half assing assignments, never listening in class, my brain feels like there’s a mental block and I can’t think clearly. I cry so much that I think it’s normal but when I tell other people they’re pretty shocked. 
My biggest obstacle rn is my career. I have no motivation to do anything related to it, my mom is forcing me to continue the internship from last summer but I willingly fucked it up and she’s screaming at me why I didn’t take it it makes no sense.

I hate how mentally weak I am that I’m given everything yet sad about the stupidest shit. I can’t feel grateful for anything I have and when I try and show gratefulness to anyone it’s so cringy to me I don’t understand why. 
Biggest eye opener to me that I was depressed was the amount of weight I lost. Everyone around me comments on how I need to eat more and I can’t fit in the clothes I fit in high school anymore and had to get new clothes. I hate my body and how small it is where I look like a child. 
I want to go to therapy but I’m scared that if it doesn’t work I’ll be trapped with depression forever. It’s my last way out and I keep pushing it aside bc either a) I think I’m getting better or 2) I’m scared it’s not gonna work and I’m out of options.

Major trigger warning: Sensitive issues 
So I tried it five months ago. I found some Seconals in a medicine cabinet. I remember watching cartoons and taking the pills one by one. A neighbour lady found me and couldn’t wake me up. I couldn’t open my eyes or move, but I heard everything. I remember the lady shaking me and saying, “Oh, my God.” I remember the ambulance people taking off my clothes and making me throw up. There wasn’t any pain. I don’t remember having my stomach pumped.
When I woke up it was five days later. A big black lady kept tickling me. “‘Bout time you woke up,” she said. “I’ve been tickling you for three days.” I thought I was in heaven — it looked like some place in heaven for the misfits. Turned out I was in the basement of a mental health clinic, a long corridor with rows of individual rooms with all kinds of teenagers, pregnant girls, suicides, drug addicts. 
We walked around in gowns, smoking cigarettes and watching TV. The reason I tried was I was angry at my baby mother, but when she came in to pick me up (the state still had her as my next of kin) she just said, “Why’d you do this — to try to get attention?” Told me Rayne didn't even recognise me; he smiled at me the moment she said that, he remembered.
Am I glad I was rescued? Oh yeah. I was so glad I didn’t die. It made me realise how much I appreciate myself, because I had a glimpse of what I might have lost in the months afterwards.
I have made some friends and I would’ve missed all that.
I didn’t have to go home after that, Peyton dropped me off at a friend's I was staying with. They put me in another hospital a week after. The State made me go to a psychiatrist. I never liked the man. I thought he had more problems than I did. 
I felt drugged and slow for a couple of months. Every now and then I’d take my medication to feel normal, largely I ignored it. Downers still make me feel speedy anyway.
You know if I had a suicidal friend now I’d ask them, “Why don’t you have any alternatives? Could it really be so awful?” That’s what I say to myself now.
The unfortunate reality is I'm lying to myself; and as every day goes past I'm edging closer and closer to where I was that day months ago, and I'm realising this time there may not be the good Samaritan to edge me out of it.",1

It's everything in me not to go crawling back to my toxic ex and beg her to take me back. After everyone cheered me for walking away for how she treated me...but not stepping forward to be a friend in her absence.

I broke out into a sweat, it felt like the air was thick and i was suffocating. The second happened Monday night. Same deal. Didn't sleep both nights. Now my last one was during class. I felt claustrophobic in an open class room and the air, once again, felt thick. I started to breath fast, and even if someone tried to talk to me to snap me out of the trance, it felt Like i fell in a rabbit hole of my own thoughts.

I've lost interest in hanging out with people much.  Even if it's something I enjoyed doing before.  I find myself going places alone.  While I don't enjoy it or find it interesting, it gets me out of bed and laying with my depression.  
I eat, sleep, go to work, come home, repeat.  I don't want to do much anymore.  At times, I've lost interest in therapy but I continue to go.  After 10 years of therapy and not much change, my interest is dwindling.

I’m pretty open about everything I feel but I’ve over saturated all my statements and everyone has gotten used to them.

I feel as though very little amount of people care about me, and of those people I feel as though they’re on the edge of giving up on me, that I’m putting too much stress on them.

test_pid_312,I don't know what to do. : My life is a mess. Honestly I don't want to die but I don't want to be here. My depression is usually never this bad but recently shits gone south hard. According to my therapist I was most likely raped as a child which I can't even fucking remember which is fantastic. I can't even tell which of my memories are real because it turns out one of my favorite memories never happened it was just my mind trying to hide things. I met this one girl who is basically me but a girl and we dated for a little bit but then she broke up with me. My therapist wants to put me either in a mental hospital for awhile or to put me on anti depressants and i know that's not that bad but I've been on pills most of my life and I just got off of them last year and I don't want to be put back on. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I made a promise to act in a musical and I know that they wouldn't be able to find a new lead in time. The other reason is that I've been waiting 2 years for the new animal crossing and I'm gonna play it even if it's the last thing I do.

I hate going to sleep because I don't want to wake up the next day, but every morning is greeted with a ""fuck"" because I woke up again. Absolute bullshit, to be honest. 
I get good grades and am successful at school. I recently interviewed and was offered jobs for two accounting positions at a renowned bank and healthcare company, but those are just paychecks to me. I'll definitely be taking one of them, but seriously fuck those jobs.
I've never had friends because I guess I'm just insufferable to be around? Whatever it is, people just straight up ignore me. Am I actually real, though? No one, throughout schooling or otherwise, has just came up and tried to have a conversation or give a simple compliment. Every time I try to talk to people it's over in two minutes, if that, because they show every indication they're not interested in my presence. Now, every time I think about talking to someone or think someone might be interested I just laugh because why would that be the case? Lmao, it's never been the fucking case. 
I'll kill myself eventually. Not yet, but that's how this fun ride will end. So yeah, my whole worldview is just apathetic. I don't give a shit and honestly don't know what it would feel like to look forward to something. Even when I go to a concert (the only thing I'll go out and do because fuck everything else), the moment I step back inside my house the moment is over and anything resembling happiness is gone.

test_pid_316,"I really do just live for the weekend’s these days. : The week is dark and dull. I dread it. I start the week with my ultimate goal of just getting to the finish line. Going to work makes my depression even worse. I come out of work at the end of the day feeling completely lifeless. Once I’m home, I have to be a mother but I don’t even have the energy to do that. My poor son is just along for the ride and most of the time mommy just can’t wait to put him to bed. Life, man. Excitement is nonexistent. The only time I feel even the smallest bit of life filling my body is on the weekends, when I don’t have to work, when there’s not a super rigid schedule, when I can breathe. But even that is short lived because I have to start preparing for the week on Sunday. Sunday’s are hard too. I start getting back into my funk. I become lifeless again. Everything becomes dark and colorless. When I wake up Monday I just want to quit everything. Everything feels so heavy. I’m tired all the time. I keep to myself at work because I don’t have the energy to speak. I don’t want people to wonder so I act like I’m fine; sometimes I even have the strength to fake a smile, even though deep down I’m screaming. 
I don’t know what keeps me going. Maybe it’s because I’m a mom and have a little one depending on me. But even the thought of having such a precious responsibility gives me anxiety and depression. I don’t feel like I can handle any of it. I can barely take care of myself.",1

test_pid_323,"Despite the successes I've made over the past few years, I can't help but feel profoundly alone and perhaps even worse, desperate for affection. : History: I am a 27-year-old Asian male. I would describe myself as at times socially adept but then at times woefully inept. I have never had a romantic relationship before. I've only asked two women out in my life; one was just getting out of a divorce, and the other was married.
I've read numerous times in places like /r/AskMen that it's important to work on myself before I subject others to myself, and all that stuff about being happy alone before being happy with someone else has helped drive me to work on being a better me. I've been content until very recently to just push aside thoughts of romantic relationships and work on becoming a better person.
But then I wonder, how long? I don't have much time left, I feel. The older I get, I feel like the less likely I am to find someone who is still single and compatible.
I finally made it into nursing school this past semester for my BSN, and I found someone in my clinical group who's so fucking smart, so hard working and so beautiful she's fucking appearing in my god damn dreams.
They're just vanilla/romantic dreams, where we just spend a day together-- and then the alarm sounds and I'm back to reality, and the dream begins to fade like smoke from a snuffed candle.
Of course, my first gut reaction to this is: ""You're infatuated with her. It's nothing but puppy love. She doesn't deserve this kind of affection and you would be doing a disservice to her and yourself if you decide to actively pursue this relationship.""
Oh, did I also mention she's 20? Seven years younger than me, and brimming with potential. I feel like I'd only drag her down.
Fuck, she's so incredible. Honor's College, TA, student-tutoring on the side, and actively pursuing research for her planned Ph.D. Her work ethic is utterly inspiring and being in her presence pushes me to work harder. We both like science fiction, we can speak on each other's level when it comes to the medical sciences and I just really enjoy being around her.
I enjoy her presence so much that I've been making an utter fool out of myself trying to get her to laugh, only to perhaps get a concerned glance from our instructors and an awkwardly quiet room.
And that's also the crazy part: I feel like I'm actually good at being a nondescript student with a slight penchant for appropriate humor, and I've worked in healthcare for eight years, and I know how to be a professional, but around her I just fucking lose damn near all sense.
But my insecurities are also still present, self-concepts that I'm working on dispelling. I'm quite short (5'2"") and she's at least a whole head taller than me, around 5'7"" or so. My research into the dating scene also reveals Asian men as one of the least desirable populations for women to date.
Of course, the other, better me says: if she cares that much about your height and ethnicity, she was never going to be a good match for you anyway.
So then I think, okay, why not just ask her out and see what happens? Then I think, what's the worst that can happen?
It could harm the group that we belong to and make it that much more awkward for the 2/3 of a semester that we have moving forwards; not to mention that we also have summer classes together as well.
Again, I think, well, if she isn't mature enough to let me down easy and keep our business between us, then maybe she wasn't ever worth it in the first place.
And then I start thinking-- why even assume anything about her and her preferences and all that in the first place?
Just ask, I think.
Just ask. Be simple, no expectations beyond just expressing a baseline interest, even if inside you're way the fuck past that.
I brim with confidence for a brief few hours and I think, listen, we'll just ask her to dinner and it doesn't have to be anything more than that. If she feels it, and we really feel it, then maybe we'll go for it. But if not, that's okay, and at least you tried.
Time passes and my doubt overshadows the fledgling confidence that I had just held.
I don't know anything about relationships. I don't even know where to begin, where to go, what to do. I have some vague ideas of how a relationship is to be; that most of a relationship will be the mundane, and that not all of it is necessarily a whirlwind tempest of passion, but a slow grind together towards shared goals.
Or maybe I'm just completely in the wrong and I actually really, truly, haven't the slightest clue of what it means to be in a relationship and my thoughts are purely fantasies and rainbows in assholes.
To further expand, I'm scared that I'm just not good enough; that I don't have the life skills or experience to keep and hold a relationship healthy and alive.
I just... I just really wish I had the guts just to do it. At least then I would know, but the threat of rejection again, after all of this stupid emotional investment would just crush me.
Anyway. I know this isn't quite on the caliber of some of the posts in here, but I'm just tired of being alone, when all of my friends are finding dates or are enjoying loving, vibrant relationships or are already happily married.
I'm... I'm just really tired of being alone and not having someone to share my life with.
Even if no one reads all of this bullshit, I'm just a bit better having written this out.

I’ve started my second semester at university after coming back from my first semester abroad. It’s a good school, and I know I’m getting a good education, but lately I’ve noticed how little time I have to myself, how exhausted and numb I feel when I listen to music I used to enjoy, and how unmotivated I am to tackle my honors classes.
Took the first step today in what I know will be a long journey, I went in and asked for help. I had a diagnostic appointment and made a plan with one of the faculty at our student center so that I can finally go see a therapist. I’m really proud of myself, and wanted to share that it’s hard taking that step, but once you’re walking, once you’re moving forward, it makes the journey that much easier!

So a little bit of an introduction, I'm 18 and recently went through a really bad breakup. We met when best friend introduced her to me and she started hanging out with the group (4 people including me and her). She made good friends with everyone and things were awesome for the time being. My favorite part of hanging out with those guys is they really got my sense of humor. Not to toot my own horn, but if the whole gang was laughing it was probably because of something I said or did, and I loved making them laugh, it made me happy seeing them happy.
After we broke up it kind of tore the whole group apart and we stopped hanging out altogether. Aside from a few friends who I only see a few times a month, I don't have anyone I can spend time with regularly. And all the people I talk to don't really seems to understand me like they did. Back then, I really took pride in the fact that I could find the humor in just about any situation but recently I feel like I've become more serious and lost touch with that. As a result not only do I not feel like myself, I feel like I've lost part of myself. 
Whenever I compare myself now to how I was back then it hurts to see how different I am, and not for the better. I felt so lively and full of energy back then, now I just feel cynical and bitter.

I miss my high school, and the people in it. everyone has moved on though.

I lose sleep to have a day with him. the past couple months we're always fighting and making up because I'm paranoid, obsessive, negative. all our problems are because of me. they stay because they insist I make them happy.

I want to break up with him for him but I also know I'm gonna crash and burn when I leave him. he's a good person. I'm the awful one. it's our 6 months. we agreedto spend time together tomorrow. yesterday he had to pick between movies with friends or spending time with me. I insisted he properly make a choice. I didnt want to get my hopes up. he chose me. today he said he wanted to watch movies with friends instead.

I just live my present days remembering my childhood, my time with my ex and my dad who passed away a couple of years ago. I’ve stopped knowing who I am because of this. It has left me with a sense of self-loathing because I feel that I’m powerless and weak (which I’ve never felt before because I always thought highly of myself). It consumes me to the point that I’m realizing I do the bare minimum to be in the present (friends, family, work, eat, etc), but the truth is my present is just a slideshow of my past and I can’t do anything to stop it. I don’t even know who I am anymore because it looks like the rest of my life is going to be just like it is now. What should I do?",1

test_pid_382,"I have to vent. I am so tired of being ghosted by women. : I'm just so tired of it. 5 girls in the past 2 weeks...all thought it was leading to dates, and yet was ghosted. Every. Single. Time.
It's unbelievable. I can't even vent anywhere aside from here, because I get judged. If you tell anyone this that a woman just randomly decides to ghost you out of the blue, they will blame you, and say you're the problem, that you did something to make her ghost you, when in reality this is just the normal thing now a days for women to do to guys.
I'm just tired of this shit. Today was the last straw. I've been talking to this girl since the weekend. Our conversations have been fairly good. She's been interested, and responds quickly. She's very into the conversation, and wanted to know more about me. I ask her out on a date for this coming Friday. She agreed, and we both still kept talking.
I thought everything was fine. All of a sudden today we were talking, and then 10 minutes later she completely removes me off social media. She blocked me off everything. She deleted me off Tinder (where I met her). I mean this is unbelievable. This is not the first time it's happened. I didn't even do anything. I didn't say anything stupid, creepy, or anything. It was a normal conversation that me and her were going back and fourth. And then she just completely removes me.
I am just so tired of this. I am beyond tired, and I just need to put this out somewhere, because no one will get it. People here will probably bash me too, like everywhere else. I can't do this anymore with women. I don't like men, and I'm not gay, but I think this is it for me. I'm 26 years old, and I'm constantly getting screwed over in possible relationships, or dates, or just anything with the opposite sex. I am just done with this. I deleted everything, including all my social media.

Sometimes I feel suicidal. I have major health issues and feel like Im causing major issues for my family. My parents def would have been much happier if I hadnt been born.
Basically, I truly never feel happy unless Im surrounded by people (party, class, random, idrc) and/or high or a strain of sativa.
Every night, I just get stoned and its random between depressed and barely not depressed.
I have no idea what to do. I dont even think I deserved to be depressed or alive. I bet im not even medically depressed, just a loser and sad from that.

""I don't know if I can do this any longer."" Heart's forlorn words made Mind blink a couple of times, the heavy weights at the corners of his mouth momentarily forgotten as his brow furrowed in thought. It's not often Heart speaks so clearly. That in itself is something to note.
""You can't do *what* any longer?"" Mind asked in confusion. Sure, they hadn't been on top of the world, but things could be so much worse. In fact, things were fine.
""I don't know. That's what scares me."" Heart replied sadly. Mind noticed his gaze was fixed on the knife in his hand. A very sharp, stainless steel knife he had used hundreds of times for cooking. It was actually his favorite kitchen knife. In this instance, he had picked it up to slice and apple for a snack. ""What do I have to do to make this stop?"" Mind looked at the knife too and felt a faint stirring of alarm begin to flower.
""I don't know *how* to make it stop. I didn't start it in the first place! I mean…can't you just ignore it?"" Mind asked. He looked nervously at the knife. He had never known Heart to do something like this. Where was this coming from? Heart turned the knife in his hand allowing the single light over the kitchen sink play across the blade. Up, down the blade it went as Heart stared at it. His right arm rotated ever so slightly, exposing the forearm for a moment.
""We've *been* ignoring it, you know that. You've been rationalizing them as 'down' days, bad days, or days where I was just being moody, even when I tried to tell you it was more than that. We've even tried to search online to figure out how to fix whatever this is and how to make it stop. It's been going on for a long time now, nearly a decade. I'm just so tired, so sad, so…"" Heart's voice trailed off as he seemed to be searching for words.
""Depressed?"" Mind supplied. Heart almost immediately started shaking his head. 
""No. Well yes...but no."" Heart responded. Mind looked confused, but then upon further reflection, he slowly nodded his head. 
""You're right. That's not it. Something caused this depression…but what? Why aren't you happy? You have every right to be happy. You are married to an amazing woman who loves you, you have a great job, and friends, and…"" Heart's frown deepened, but he kept his eyes on the blade.
""And what?"" He prompted, then shook his head angrily. ""The fruits of my labors have been what? If I die tomorrow, what will be missed? The provision I supply, the money I donate, and…why are you shaking your head?"" Heart demanded angrily. ""You know it's true."" Mind sighed. He's heard this one many times before.
""People love you."" Mind stated. ""You know that."" Heart's grip tightened on the knife, and a bitter expression suddenly filled his face.
""But I get all the broken ones!"" He hissed. ""I get them, and then I feel like I have to help them, and do whatever I can to help them heal, to mend those broken things. I have to teach them about what love is, or what a good friend is, how to trust again, how to smile again, but what about me?!"" His voice is now an angry shout. ""I look back and every time I get the broken ones. Yes, I love them, but what about romantic love? What about someone seeing to *my* needs?"" Heart asked hotly. ""Why do I always come last?! Why am I always treated as an afterthought?! Just *once* I want to not just love someone, but to be *in* love! Just once I want for someone to…to…well fuck it. What does it matter?"" Heart's head drops and his shoulders slump. He sighs sadly, and places the knife on the cutting board next to the apple Mind had placed there moments before. Mind was silent for a bit trying to absorb what Heart was trying to say, and what he had said.
""I…think I am starting to understand."" Mind said uncertainly. ""But what can we do? We've made our choices, you and I. We can't go tearing it all apart just because we're not happy. It affects everyone else around us. I know you, and you would not want to hurt those people. Tearing everything up in an effort to find…whatever it is you're looking for would do just that."" Heart swallowed hard, and his eyes watered.
""But I can't keep going on like this either."" He said quietly. ""I cry so easily, and at the dumbest things. I get jealous for the dumbest reasons, and when I find a new friend, I cling too tightly…and that's just the tip of the iceberg. You know that. This is not how a normal person acts."" Mind nodded tiredly. He was exhausted, really. He was *always* exhausted.
""I know…and it's starting to affect me, too. I have had much more difficulty focusing, and it keeps getting worse. I can't ever rest until I'm exhausted. Believe me, I'm as tired as you are, though for different reasons. I thought we would be doing something a lot different than we are right now, and - quite frankly - making a chunk more money than we are. Granted, it hasn't been effecting me for nearly as long as it has you."" Mind confessed. Mind and Heart gazed at the apple, then picked up the knife and efficiently sliced it. A tear slid down Heart's face, and as they finished slicing the apple, Heart sniffed his nose, stifling a sob.
""See what I mean? This is stupid. I'm crying. Why?"" Heart said. 
A sad smile touched Mind's face as he replied, ""Also ironic. It seems we're just as broken."" Heart scoffed, then looked at the knife. The blade glistened with apple juice.
""Let's just take a sleeping pill and get a good night's rest."" Heart suggested resignedly. ""Maybe that will help."" Mind nodded. He desperately needed more than a few hours of sleep. It sounded as good of an idea as any, but then looked at the knife.
""Yeah, but after we clean the knife."" He said.",1

When I open up to the people close to me I always end up feeling worse than I did keeping everything inside. I can tell my mom and my few close friends are sick of my shit. My mom absolutely blames me for not being what she considers to be a productive member of society. I am a full-time college student with a workload I am struggling to stay on top of, yet she feels I have too much free time and should get a part-time job. She believes this will make me less depressed. She takes it very personally when I don't tell her how sad I am but when I do she makes me feel so much worse. I understand that I am partially responsible for how I react to my depression but fuck I'm trying my best. At least I think I am. Or else I have deluded myself into believing I'm the victim when in reality, I am just a lazy piece of shit who needs to stop feeling sorry for myself and get a job like everyone else.

test_pid_417,"I Don't Know What to Do : **This is a pretty long speech so if you're not interested in reading something long, it's okay**
As a high school male Asian student, I've been pressured every day to do more than I can. Today, for example, my ACT score came out and I did a little bit worse than my first test (From a 33 to a 32). My mom started yelling what was going in my head while taking it and she started comparing me with others who ""cut out the practice problems they got wrong to look at later"" or how ""everyone in this test got good scores"". Now, I know this is clearly my fault and I definitely could have done better, but I have trouble concentrating while taking a test, especially a four hour one.
What angers me so much is that whenever my mom yells at me for doing something wrong, she repeats the same thing she said in a different way at least five to seven more times. She would take small breaks in between to. I understand what I did wrong the first time she said it, but the fact that she repeats it over and over again makes me want to break something, but I can't because I've had those scenarios in the past because I couldn't take it anymore and it ended with my dad grabbing me by the collar of my shirt, ready to punch me.
Now, the reason why I stay silent whenever my parents yell at me for something I'm doing wrong is because as soon as I speak, tears already start flowing down, my voice already begins to quiver, and I start stuttering frequently. In my mind, I want none of this to happen because it makes me look like a coward, when I actually want to look serious.
Lastly comes me as a person in general. From time to time, I start to think if people will care if I suddenly disappeared one day. I'm a junior, yet I'm already overweight, I have REALLY bad eyesight that I can barely see without my eyes, and I have almost no charisma. With this in mind, I just start to wonder if people would care if I died one day.
Sorry for making this a long speech, but I thought you would need this background info to give the advice. I recently took a quiz on this website ([https://depression.org.nz/is-it-depression-anxiety/self-test/depression-test/](https://depression.org.nz/is-it-depression-anxiety/self-test/depression-test/)) and I got a score of 20 out of 27, which I think is moderately severe depression. I never thought of myself of being moderately severely depressed, but now that I'm seeing this, I'm not sure what to do. I'm 100% sure my parents would not let me do counseling because they would just claim I'm not depressed in the first place and that it's a waste of money (we're also barely financially stable so paying for counseling is probably not going to work). My school counselor is absolutely terrible at her job so she isn't helpful at all. I don't know if I have anyone to trust and talk to at this point. So now I'm here with my soul literally crumbling into pieces without anyone knowing because I don't know who to tell or what to do. What should I do?",1

test_pid_424,"Mental breakdowns before going to school/work : First time posting on reddit, long time lurker. Just would like to see how many people can relate. I can’t even count how many times I’ve had a mental breakdown the day/night before school or work. Sane people would probably need a day or two to recover. I always manage to get to school/work the next day after. Not sure if that’s a good thing or not. This was pointless, I’m sorry.",1
test_pid_425,"depression symptoms have changed? : So last summer I was super depressed. The big symptoms were I felt like a major burden, couldn’t focus, didn’t eat a lot, and felt sad with myself and life.
Fast forward a couple months and Don’t have those symptoms but right now for the past 3-4 months I avoid social situations, excessive sleeping and fatigue.
Could I possibly be relapsing and not realize it till now? Or could these depressive symptoms be a sign of a coming relapse?",1
test_pid_426,"I’m tired : At this point it’s useless. I can’t do it anymore, at this point giving I feel like is pointless because it’s all I can do. I have a shit personality that nobody would want to be around, try to do good things for people to try and impress but probably just get disregarded in the process, don’t have any actual friends (just people who keep me around either for free stuff or out of pity that they don’t show), and just make people hate me when they talk to me because my existence is pestering and shouldn’t exist. I only give and do things for people because it’s all I can do, I can’t make people smile or laugh. At this point I’m just a waste of fucking space and don’t deserve to live on this planet, and should just end it all successfully this time. Small vent I guess.",1

I am sleeping decently for some periods of time, and other times I sleep horribly for multiple weeks. Now I am sleeping well, but I sometimes get anxious in the evening that tonight I will sleep bad, or just feel generally at unease. 
Do you feel this as well? How do you cope with this? Tonight I woke up several hours before I usually do, which is usually what happens during my long periods of insomnia, but during my insomnia period it is not caused by anxiety.",1
test_pid_429,Turning 30 is freaking me out : I think one of the reasons I’m freaking out most is because I’ve already wasted a decade of my life (my 20’s). I know I’m capable of it and the idea of wasting another 10 years is possible and scary as fuck.,1

Do elaborate on the situation. I've been struggling with depression since 14. I would like to blame my family/work environment for constantly hampering my recovery + the cause of it but I wonder how much of it is actually MY fault and what I can do about it.

I simply don’t matter to anyone.  I don’t matter enough to eat regularly. I don’t matter enough to take care of myself.  I don’t even matter enough to get help.

I’m staying at a friend’s place now.  Trying to cope.  My anxiety has been so bad lately and I’ve wanted nothing more than to give up completely.  I know that this is selfish but I don’t want to be alone.  I can’t handle myself.  I understand why he couldn’t handle me either.  I want to make new friends but I don’t feel like socializing.  When I do socialize I feel hopeless afterwards. Most of the time I know that the friendship or acquaintance won’t last.  Things never last with me.  Friends and relationships come and go.  I remain.

test_pid_437,"How do I know if I have depression? : So, pretty much my entire life I've been a pretty sensitive guy, but ever since the new year my whole life has been pretty shitty. At the start of the year my mother had a miscarriage, and that hit me pretty hard. Ever since that my parents have been arguing a ton more after hearing them fight through the walls I've figured out that we are moving back the old state we used to live in about a decade ago. After hearing that I've just been really sad, and I've had no motivation to do anything in life, and my grades have been falling since the start of the semester. Also, since January I've pretty much been putting on a front. More recently, I've been doing a bit better but not much. I basically just focus on using things like music and video games to distract me from being sad. Even when everything in life is going amazing I still feel really sad. An example of this happening would be yesterday, which was my birthday. For no reason yesterday I was really upset and spent most of my day just laying in bed watching youtube trying not to cry, and nothing bad was going on, I just default to being sad now. Sorry if I sounded super edgy, but if anyone could help me that would be great.",1

I feel like my life is a fucking joke. I can't focus on anything I want to do and I feel like my life is going nowhere. I fucking hate this and I want it to end. It sucks cause I'm the fucking problem and I can't make up excuses. I can't talk about how depressed I am because I'm fucking bisexual but can't say cause I live in a homophobic household.

I mean I dont have a bad life, I have friends, a loving family and even a beautiful loving girlfriend, but I so rarely feel genuinely happy. Even when I'm with my friends I have a nagging thought, ig, that I still want to die. Thoughts of bashing my own head in or shooting myself are common, and when I'm at work I often think about cutting.

test_pid_442,I hate sleeping : Cause then I know that I’m gonna have to wake up tomorrow in no time and start all over again. I just want to take some time to breathe. Why do the days just keep going by quicker and quicker? I hate it so much.,1
test_pid_443,"I feel like the only ugly girl in the world : Holy shit women are so fucking beautiful. And I look nothing like any of them. I’m skinny as a rail, with a big nose and forehead, untamable hair, I look like a walking preying mantis. I’ve always been silently cowed by how beautiful everyone else seems, but ever since I met my boyfriend in senior year, I’ve been triple upset with my body. He follows beautiful women on every social media, from effortlessly flawless to purposefully sexy. There’s nowhere that he looks that isn’t filled with out of this world stunning girls. I can’t do makeup for shit, I hate my body so bad. I literally have no boobs, and barely any ass. I’m hideous, and while I admire everyone else that are straight 10/10s, it makes me hate myself a little more every time. 
Sometimes I get on a kick to do squats, eat a lot more, I even bought an eyeshadow palette to experiment. But after so long with no results, or after scrolling through pages of unattainable beauty, I give up, over and over again. I stop eating sometimes for days, I don’t want to shower or brush, I don’t take my hair down from it’s ratty ponytail. My clothes are dirty, I’m having an acne breakout, I feel overwhelmed with how ugly and off putting I am. I don’t even have a redeeming personality, although that’s the thing my boyfriend says he likes about me most. And that I’m “too cute” to think about sexually unless we’re actually having sex (read; why would he fantasize about me when literally everyone else on earth exists? And I get that) I’ve always been that girl that everyone tells their crushes too. Never considered “in the pool” of people to flirt with, so I always helped my friends manage their relationships, watched them getting valentines, listened to the guys tell me about how hot other girls are. I get desperate to improve myself, but then too horribly depressed to try and as I result I get uglier inside and out everyday and there’s no stopping it.",1
test_pid_444,"I’m getting kind of tired : Every time I get upset or sad I tend to isolate myself but instead of returning I just continue to isolate myself even more and more. It’s becoming extremely overwhelming every time I want to go to my friends about anything because I just feel like I’m burdening them. But I constantly catch myself crying silently for hours and every time I type a message I end up deleting it. It’s really hard to stay silent all the time, I want to speak up so badly. I really want support but I don’t know where to go for it. I just feel like I have no one. I genuinely hate myself for getting this low but I think I just hate myself in general.

test_pid_446,"How to Cope? : I have been going through some extremely paingul and difficult stuff lately. Confronting my own issues and wrongdoings. Fighting my own needs so that I don't hurt others. Marriage is a hot mess that seens worse each day. Trying to hold it all together. Trying to piece it back together. Attempting to maintain a normal exterior while mentally I am a wreck. Thinking that death, or just not feeling anymore would be easier. 
How do you cope with this? My therapist says I need to find a creative outlet, a trusted confidant, breathing exercises, honesty, and confidence. But I cant afford to buy the materials for the creative outlets I like, and I dont have access to what I need. I don't feel like I can trust people, because everyone I ever have has hurt me. Breathing doesn't do anything for me. I try to be honest but my words come out wrong, or they just make things worse. And i haven't been confident in myself ever in my life.

I have great coping mechanisms and I've been making wonderful strides towards being healthier.
But school has been awful. I'm falling behind in credits, I need 100 volunteer hours to graduate but I don't have the time nor the transportation to do so, my friendships are falling apart, and I can't cope with anything anymore. My anxiety has gotten horrible. I can barely handle being at school. It's almost 1am and about an hour ago I started thinking about going to school tomorrow, and I flipped out. I threw some ( small and nonbreakable ) things around my room, rocked back and forth violently for a few minutes, and then laid on the floor after banging my head against it. I then got up, got dressed, went outside in freezing cold temperatures, and started to walk down the street before realizing what I was doing and turning back.

test_pid_451,"Back at square one after assault : This is probably not the thread to post this at but I really have no will to live and feel like what happened this weekend really validates it. 
I finally mustered up enough courage and strength to get out of the house to meet mutual friends for dinner and a few drinks. I planned to go straight home after that but was persuaded to stay because I ""looked like I needed it"" We end up at one of the mutual friend's houses (P to keep things easy) and a few more people showed up. P came up to check on me and gave me another drink, she said she'd watch out for me and if I still felt like I needed to go home she'd have someone take me. 
About 30mins after that drink, I needed to use the bathroom. P showed me the way and held my drink for me. Then things get extremely blurry. I tell her that I need to go home and she has a friend take me. He was kind and kept talking to me and kept asking if he needed to stop (in case I needed to puke) He walks me in and supports most of my weight but I can feel his hand traveling. I struggled and squirmed away from him but that caused me to fall and then I don't remember anything. The next thing I do remember is waking up in my bed with my clothes ripped and not on properly and feeling like I'd been battered all over. I stumble to the bathroom and in tears feeling like the biggest moron for going out. I notice there's vomit and small splatters of blood on the floor. I scrubbed myself raw and washed all my clothes and the bathroom at 4 am. (Tell me again how big of an idiot I am. That could've been potential evidence) I think he assaulted and may have raped me. 
I've tried to get in touch with P, I've called and texted but she won't answer. If I just hadn't gone out that night. I was depressed before but that kept me somewhat safe and inside the house. My biggest safety issue was myself. Now I can't sleep because of the nightmares and feeling like the moment I walk out my door it'll happen again. I couldn't stop it from happening as a child and here I am again, right back at square 1. I can't do this anymore.",1

test_pid_463,"back again : hi /r/depression 
it's been a while.  
I've been going to support groups. I've been managing to make myself exercise.  I've been keeping track more of my diet and keeping my gastrointestinal disease in remission.  I've been taking vitamins and drinking water.  I've been volunteering.  I've even gone to networking events.  I've been keeping a normal sleep schedule, dressing nicely, and grooming carefully.  I've let myself believe that maybe I have found an avenue to getting employed, supporting myself, and staying employed.  I've let myself believe that maybe there is a way for me to climb out of the depths and into the sun.
I've been setting goals, spending almost all day out of the house going from one thing to the next.  I've been letting myself take on more in my schedule and checking in with myself when bad thought patterns surface.  Sometimes I've decided to believe in myself preemptively in order to give something the best attempt.  I've been getting better.
And yet today I've felt like dying.  I've felt incapable of progress.  I've felt incapable of just enduring the endless cycle; days beginning and ending, coming and going, filled with pressure, doubts, stress, pain, weight, discouragement, grief.  I've felt pointless.  I've felt like a solitary person stranded at sea in a life raft.  Like the last person still alive after a worldwide pandemic.  Surrounded by nothingness, destruction, decay.  Completely devoid of purpose, direction, or meaning.
I think of everyone I've known along my life who was my age and has already died.  Freak accidents, falls, suicides, violent riots, fires, disease.  There is no fairness.  There is no justice.  There is no redemption.  
I'm so tired.  I'm so beyond bored of the same and the same and the same and the same and the same.  I'm tired of lacking the will to even inhale and exhale.  If my body didn't autonomically manage breathing along with everything else, I probably would have called it quits at some point already.
What am I going to do?  I'm not going to kill myself.  I have enough buffer to wait around here a little longer and see what happens.  I'm not on the brink, tip-toeing on the edge of something so visceral that I need to consider drastic action.  I'm going to wait a little longer just like I have done all my life.  Wait around a little longer for living to begin making more sense.  I'm going to keep going back to support group, to the only people who know who I am.  I'm going to tell myself that I believe in me.  I'm going to see if I can find a way to make that true.  I'm going to keep pretending like I can fix things with good sleep, good diet, good exercise, good socializing.  And if I actually can then I'll find out.  I'm going to wish I could stop spending so much time on the internet, rotting my brain.  Maybe even pass a few days succeeding in abstaining.  But without genuine, meaningful obligations, my brain will slip into withdrawal of engagement and I'll have to relapse on modern day's pernicious addiction.

Like my existence so far has had no impact on them so if I weren't even here, they'd still go on with their lives and they invalidated my feelings and told me they don't believe that I actually think that. 
I had high functioning depression since HS, I'm now 23, so I feel like no one takes me seriously when I say I hate myself. I'm an advocate for mental health. I've seen the declination in friends and family who have suffered from depression. My sibling even once had an episode and tried to commit suicide and put the reasoning for wanted to die on me, and that has taken the biggest toll on me. Obviously I don't want my sibling or anyone else to die so I'm an advocate and generally share positive things on my social media. But someone telling you that you're the reason they want to die is fucking devasting.
From the outside looking in, I guess I'm okay... when I eas in school, I still woke up every morning, get out of bed, and got good grades but what good is it all if I don't fucking love myself? I hate that I'm such a burden on my family. They pushed me so hard to achieve academic success and even went so far as to rearrange their own life goals to help me get that far. I graduated top of my class, and am ""debt"" free because they paid for my housing and tuition. Despite being a college graduate, I am financially dependent on my family. I haven't been able to land a job and it's eating away at my self esteem and self worth. Nothing in my field is hiring near home and no one thinks I can take care of myself so moving out of state is out of the question. 
These past few months, my depression has been getting worse but I don't outwardly show it. I'm finding it difficult to motivate myself to get out of bed and do household chores. Since I'm currently unemployed, I'm expected to do things around the house while everyone is at work. When they get home, if I haven't completed my tasks, they make comments like, ""oh what were you doing all day?"" Or they tell me to do things and say, ""You do it, I'm tired from working."" My family is Asian and so mental health isn't addressed or taken seriously, so I try to keep everything to myself. I cried in the shower for 20 minutes today and then went about my day like nothing happened. At around 1-2 in the morning, I find myself awake often and I just cry wishing that I was never born",1
test_pid_472,"I’m depressed but definitely not suicidal : So it all started when my dad passed a few months ago. I quit my job so I could join this program at my community college. Basically went to school mon-Friday 8am - 4pm so I can get this certificate that was supposed to get me a job in the chemical plants. It has been 3 months since that and still no job and my old one doesn’t want me back. My car motor exploded out of nowhere and I have no money to fix it. The people I live with are the pettiest people ever towards me even though I literally stay in my room all day and night and don’t come out unless it’s to shower, wash clothes, food, or to leave the house. I have been continuing my education and my grades are slipping. I have no motivation to work out. I just don’t have any happiness or anything positive in my life right now. The only thing that keeps me from going off the edge is my wonderful girlfriend she is the absolutely best. Oh and if I even talk to my mom about my problems all she says is just go get some medicine. I DONT WANT TO RELY ON FUCKING MEDS!!!!!! I just need to find some type of passion.

I've read other people's post putting into words what i couldnt and it gives me solidarity and helps with the shame. Some days i want to just run and run in hopes that somehow ill jolt out of this. I never do though, the more i dream about running away the deeper i sink into my bed and the stiller my body becomes. It's as if I'm physically rejecting the fantasy, but even if i fulfilled it what would  be gained other than a hollow escape? As awful as it is, putting it into words helps at least. To everyone else out there i hope ive given you something to relate to as others have done for me on here. You're not alone, and these feelings aren't a choice.

test_pid_481,"""It's going to be fine"" : That kind of positive thinking is exactly how I landed into depression you dumbass. By repeatedly telling myself that things would improved on their own, only to end in a awful cycle of hopes and disapoitments.
 I recently watched  the video ""Stop wasting your life"" by Prince Ea and realized I've been a Jae for 27 years.
I f\*cking hated high school. Most of my teachers were jerks, I had bad grades, got shamed and yelled for it at home, had only one friend (and even then, I only saw him at school), got anxiety for being closeted among openly homophobic peers and was insanely jealous of my sister always going out with friends while I stayed home playing video games. Oh and my estranged father stopped giving a shit about us the second my mother took exclusive custody of my sister and I. I told myself that teenagehood was a hard part of life and that I would be happier later.
During the summer after graduation, I was the happiest and most hopeful I ever was. High school was FINALLY behind me. I was going study more interesting things (literature), I would meet more mature classmates, I was going to eventually find love. Well, that after a rough start, my life was finally beginning....
Except, it was EVEN WORSE than high school. Cursus were insanely hard, boring and while classmates were more matures, I still failed to connect and make friends out of them because I still had anxiety while they enjoyed their life. Oh and since my university was in my city, I never left my mother's home so just like high school, I immediatly went back home after class and never went to parties. My numbers of friends went from ONE to ZERO.
I told myself that It was just one year wasted and that next year was going to be better.
Long story short, I ended doing an easier but boring course in administration with older pears I also failed to connect with. I told myself it was going to be better once I find a job. I spend then 3 years unemployed and bored home at work and ashamed of it.
Once I got a job, It took me six months to burn out because of the stress and loneliness. I'm stuck in a small office with no colleagues in sight waiting for the end of the day. Oh and I only had 10 days off the whole year.
Now, I realize as a 27 year old friendless virgin that youth just went past me. I've been brainwashed by society and myself into believing that I was going for a bright future that has never come and never will while my high school acquaintances have fullfilled lives and have long left their parents home and starting to have kids.
While taking mindfulness cursus to cure my depression, I learned that I spent my life daydreaming about another world than living in the reality and the present.
So don't you dare tell me ""It's going to be fine"".",1

It wasn’t anything personal - more, small venue, a friend who lives far away who doesn’t see them much. But it still stings. Another friend of mine who did go called me apologetic, but of all the stuff he’s gone through, mine is nothing! He deserves to relax.
Anyways, stings a little but I’m not going to stop talking and hating them. Just going on a little exile from social media.

Like many here, I've (18) had depression and anxiety since before I even knew what the words mean't
Last year,  was my senior year in high school, I was at the top of my class and I had big plans to get into a prestigious college and finish off my high school career excelling. God, The Universe or whatever all mighty being that controls us however, had other plans for me. My life seemed to fall apart piece by piece in front of me.
This may seem crazy to some but it was the beginning of my devastation. My HS releases the top 10% of the graduating class every year (by GPA) and posted the order and the students' pictures in front of the auditorium. I am a quiet and shy person and I felt this was my chance to prove myself and it was something I strove hard for. When the results came out, I realized I had missed the cut. After speaking to my friends and comparing the GPA's of the students on the list, I realized I missed it by 0.005 points.
At the time, my sister (20) was at odds with me and my family over a myriad of issues including her arrogant asshole boyfriend who she refused to leave no matter how many times she was manipulated by him. I was extremely close to my sister throughout our childhood, but she, along with her boyfriend repeatedly disrespected and took advantage of my parents and I. Facing all of this family conflict I sat there powerless. My words mean't nothing to my parents or my sister and despite the fact that my sister ended up getting kicked out of the house after an argument, my parents continued to pay for her $45k tuition. I loved my sister and when I contacted her truly offering my best advice, she wouldn't hear anyof it. She threatened to cut me out of her life for good.
I was distraught, and due to this and the accumulation of the depression over the years of stress, I finally broke. I ended up missing missing over a quarter of the school year (mostly consecutively) while I was enrolled in mostly AP level classes including Physics C (E&amp;M in one year), Calc BC (including AB content), and US Gov/Pol. During my time away from school I began self harm, thoughts of suicide grew, We searched desperately for help, and I had to convince a Doctor to not have me put in an adolescent psychiatric ward as I sat on his patient table (I have nothing against good psychiatric wards, I just knew it wasn't the right choice for me). Eventually I found my match a pnp saved my life, medicated me correctly and I was on my way to recovery.
However, now I was faced with the challenge of catching up on 3 intense AP classes while remaining stable. My teachers all advised me to drop my classes, but I refused. on my transition back I worked the hardest I had ever worked before. I was allowed 2 weeks of half days to help myself acclimate, and everyday those two weeks I came home and watched my teachers math videos from 12 pm to 7 pm on double speed. I followed all the class notes, and did all the homework. I was able to catch myself up completely (except for tests taken) to the rest of the class within those 2 weeks. I ended that year with 5s on all my APs except History.
This was the biggest accomplishment of my life and I was extremely proud and while I missed a few college application during my time out of school I was accepted into an Engineering program at a School ranked in the top #15 for Engineering in the U.S. that year.  
I wanted to share this to show you guys since many like myself think its the end when something like this happens, but you can persevere with the right help and determination.   
Don't read more if u want a story to have a good ending :/
I wish I could tell you I stayed in a good state of mind after all that but sadly I've fallen in darker times than I have ever experienced. I rarely leave the house, and I wake up every morning depressed with a lack of will to live. I chose to take a semester off from college after I came close to killing myself and moved back home with my family. Things have been extremely rough and I'm starting to feel like the people I used to be able to count on are no longer there for me. I feel lost and the prospect of suicide seems more and more inviting as the days pass. I have other University prospects and am on a search for a part time job but my motivation falls everyday and my will to carry on has fallen to an all time low. I can no longer even describe how horrible I feel, and realistically the only thing that has stopped me from ending it all is my friends and family and I can bare the thought of how it would affect them. I have resorted to heavy use of marijuana and abusing the increasingly higher dose of drugs I'm being given for my symptoms. I've blacked out from these drugs once so far and truly believe I could have died from the combination I took (obv this was not the recommended usage of the drugs).
I feel like I'm at the end of the road and if things dont get better soon I may have to find my own way out.  
I wouldn't wish this upon anyone and truely hope all of you guys suffering from mental illness your best life possible

But for me its never been myself claiming everybody hates me. i think i am an average person not too bad but not too great either, ive just always been unhappy with myself. I don't think its quite as bad as it was last year with thoughts and plans about killing myself in the very week and coming close to cutting (which I couldn't bring myself to do). My normal mood or default mood is unhappy. But it seems I do think about killing myself in the future with detailed planning. I don't remember why exactly, but in my mind I believe that im going to end up killing myself in my mid to late twenties.

test_pid_497,"I'm allowing depression to stop me from being the man I want to be : I didn't have an easy life up to this point. There are people who have had it harder than me but when you spend the bulk of your life getting beaten down to the point where you just begin to accept the beatings, you know something is wrong.
I've been doing a ton of self reflecting and through listening to people in the psychology field, I am now realizing that I've fell short of what it means to be a man.
I don't mean the traditional, muscled up, jack of all trades, rough around the edges kind of man. A man to me is someone who can take life's challenges on the chin and take responsibility for his actions in all circumstances. There are times a man may falter but a man gets up again, reevaluates and overcomes. 
A man wants to provide the best life for not only himself but those that he cares for most. Whether that's financial security or just making sure he's happy and by extension the people around him are happy.
My familial connections are severely damaged because I couldn't live up to the mountain of expectations put on me. I grew up bullied because I was taught standing up for myself was wrong. I endured six years of abuse from an ex because of that mentality after I had graduated. I spiralled into depression and stopped giving a fuck about my health. I gave up nearly all of my friends and overindulged in hobbies that aren't healthy while giving up the ones that were.
I made bad decision after bad decision. Even when I made good decisions I didn't have the mental fortitude or discipline to see it through. I made excuses. I'm very depressed and very lost and quite frankly, I've given up on myself for quite some time.
But I want to be a man.
I want to be the man I know my father is despite our differences. He's still my image of a good man though we're polar opposites. He overcame so much controversy in his life and no matter the obstacle he buckled down and persevered better than any person I've ever met. I don't know if he suffers with depression but given what I know of his upbringing, most people wouldn't have survived, especially not unscathed.

test_pid_500,i'm so tired : there's no way i'll be able to find/get a job. none of this is working i'd rather die,1
test_pid_501,"Mental Health issues in University (rant) : I'm a third year in a fairly high-up university in the UK, and I'm just completely cracking under the pressure now.
I realised I wasn't a massive fan of my course early on and did try to switch, but didn't have the necessary A-levels to go to a different course in the same university and my parents managed to convince me to not change universities.
I only have a few more months until I'm finished for good but the pressure has got too much; I suffer from PTSD as well as depression and the flashbacks have gotten intense recently, usually putting me out of commission for some time afterwards. I don't understand what triggers them so I'm just terrified the next one will happen. Funny thing is, as horrific as the flashbacks are, it's the fact that I find it difficult to work after having one that bothers me the most. 
Even getting up every day has become increasingly difficult and I'm resorting to unhealthy behaviours just to sort of cope. Any time off I take makes me feel extremely guilty, because I feel like I should be working constantly to keep up with everyone else. 
Somehow I've managed to submit my work on time so far and not been kicked out, but I'm writing this post instead of doing an assignment due at midnight tonight because I just don't understand it...I'm severely under the word limit, it mostly isn't coherent and I can't see myself passing the assignment at all. I would ask my lecturer for help but strikes mean that he isn't answering his email/isn't around. I'm running on less than two hours of sleep (not without trying to sleep) and every time I realise I can't do the work, I start to panic and my mind goes blank. 
Worst thing is, I know that this is my fault. My fear of failure and perfectionism means that I was putting off an assignment I found difficult because I didn't want to admit that I couldn't do something. My self-worth is definitely wrapped up around grades and intelligence, so finding out that I'm probably not particularly intelligent has been a difficult journey. I understand that being academically gifted isn't the only form of self-worth, but it feels like that's all I had to be proud of before I went to university. 
I know that one failed assignment is not the end of the world, and I could resit the year or the module, but I can't bring myself to submit something that isn't at least somewhat decent...thinking about it makes me feel nauseous. I'd almost rather not submit anything and fail automatically than submit the utter mess that I have so far. It feels like I've hit a wall, that there is no alternative to failing this, and that terrifies me. 
My family life is extremely difficult and is the source of my PTSD, but I find myself wishing I could just run away from all this to my home. Every time I go to bed I dream about somehow escaping or being in a freak accident that means I can't continue university, or somehow skipping past all of this hell to when I'm completely finished. I can't drop out now as that would be a waste of the last 2 and a half years of my life as well as god knows how much money, but I can feel myself losing my grip on my emotions more every day. I know my mental health problems aren't an excuse for my lack of effort, but sometimes I find it near impossible to sleep, eat, exist, never mind work tirelessly for hours on end. I find my attention wandering every five minutes and I don't know why. 
I don't know how the people around me are submitting decent assignments each time, and it feels like I'm the idiot for not understanding some of the work properly.  Being a high-ish achiever in sixth form but then seemingly struggling immensely whilst everyone else gets on with it is really distressing. I feel like I somehow got into this university by a fluke, and any decent marks that I get are false or mismarked, and that any lower marks I get are a true representation of my worth. I am filled with so much self hatred that sometimes it's difficult to see why anyone would bother being around me. I genuinely don't understand why my friends are still friends with me, as I feel like I contribute nothing of worth to a relationship.
And I do know that this isn't the be-all and end-all to life, but at the moment it feels like it.  I know this probably sounds like someone whining about small problems, but I feel like it's destroying me. I regret ever accepting the offer to go to this university, and wish I could go back and choose to go to a less intense university.
If these are meant to be the best days of my life, then I don't think that bodes well for the rest of it. (Though I've never really believed that that's true.)

test_pid_502,my school nearly had me admitted to inpatient (long rant) : so this all happened yesterday and i’m still kind of in shock about it and i don’t think i’ve processed it yet. i had written a list (last week) of 3 things i had to complete before march 21st before i killed my self and i fucking lost the note. some kid at school found it and handed it into my teacher and somehow they figured it out that it was me who wrote it (i think i was on a watch list or something). they call be into my student wellbeing office and tell me they found it and they’ve called my parents and i freak the fuck out and i don’t know how to take it in and then my mum comes to the school and they tell her about the note and she’s panicking and crying and shit and we all go sit in a room and they basically tell her that she has to take me to hospital immediately because i’m in crisis. which is bullshit because i felt fine emotionally because my date was a month away and i was not feeling suicidal at all. i keep asking i don’t want to be put into adult inpatient (i’m 18) and they’re insisting that i will be admitted to inpatient and i’m terrified of that. i keep asking if i can just go home and change my clothes first and my well-being keeps telling my mum that if i go into my room i might be going to grab a blade or something to off myself then and there which sure i understand protocol but i just want comfy clothes. then i’m escorted by two teachers to my locker so i can grab my bag and they have to carry it and then my dad arrives and my parents take me home so i can get changed and then we go the hospital. we wait in the er for like 5 hours before an assessment mental health person sees us and she’s really nice in really glad i spoke to her but she lets me go home because of my honesty or whatever as long as i went to a appointment this morning. i got a call this morning asking how i am and if i tried to kill myself overnight and then telling me to go to this appointment which i do and we just talk about a bunch of symptoms and shit and now i have a appointment with a psychiatrist next week. i feel like i’ve shut down because i’m somehow kind of calm but i’m so confused because everyone was treating it like i’d attempted already when i was clear about it not happening until next month and now everyone’s so fucking patronizing towards me and i’m so embarrassed to go back to school next week and have to talk to the well-being counselor who saw me freak the fuck out and was insistent that i would be taken into inpatient. like i wasn’t suicidal because i told myself it was happening next month but now if anything that the situation is escalated i feel 10x worse and so fucking numb i’m just really confused and freaked out. and so far the only treatment mentioned has been therapy? and i don’t want to ask for fucking meds in case they’ll think i’m a junkie but i really thing i need something chemical instead of just talking about shit because it hasn’t worked before,1

test_pid_508,"i feel isolated and like a failure : TW: self harm
This is just going to be a vent/brain dump because everything is too much right now and i need to get it out.
I know that having depression means that life often feels a million times harder but lately it's been feeling impossible. My mum died last year and it feels like I'm expected to be 'over it' by now. I've been taking antidepressants for probably a year now, but in the past few months they've been making me feel constantly dizzy and nauseated. I am exhausted 24/7 and doing even the most basic tasks feels like it uses all my physical and emotional energy.  
My boyfriend has moved to a different town and both of our cars are currently broken meaning that we can only see each other on the weekends, which normally would be fine but my anxiety brain is making me self-sabotage the relationship and trying to convince me that he doesn't love me anymore, and with no physical contact for a week, it's hard for the logical, non-mentally ill part of my brain to disagree.
My mum died last year and it feels like people expect me to be over it by now. Like the people close to me get surprised if I get sad about her and I don't want to feel rushed in my grieving. Similarly, I just don't think those closest to me truly understand the extent of my depression no matter how much I try to explain it to them. 
Today just felt impossible. I'm not sure why it was today exactly but everything was too much, my friends were too loud, the distance between my boyfriend and i was too far, and my brain was too busy for me to even try and form a logical thought. i self-harmed in the shower. Before tonight i was probably close to around a year with no self harming. i feel like a failure.
i  just want a hug and someone to tell me that it'll be okay and that they love me even though my brain tries to convince me that i don't deserve love and that one day things will get better.

I've never actually cut myself and idk, when my therapist asks me about self harm I don't know whether I should say it, does it even count?

I have an overwhelming amount of pressure to succeed and make my mum proud. She's always been really strict with me and has always told me that I have to work hard and never stop no matter the consecuences, but I'm just not okay like this. 
Everything that could be going wrong in my life is actually becoming real: I'm currently stuck in the first year of a college degree that I despise with my whole heart, not only because of the degree itself but because of the classmates that I have, which have little to zero empathy and judge people by their looks. They're just straight up mean if you're not like them and life there is literally hell. Even worse than highschool. Not only that, but me and my long term partner broke things up early this year, my grandpa passed away, everyone on my dad's side is depressed or ill in some type of way (and I somehow feel like I have to carry their problems with me) and my mum doesn't want me to leave this fucking degree in fear that I might stop studying (which makes zero fucking sense to me, because I truly want to study a degree, just one that I actually like). 
What I feel is that, I don't have physical time to neither decide or take action on what I'm supposed to do to get better, because my mum refuses to allow me that time or believe that I'm having a really hard time at all. She just blames me and says that I'm too weak, that life is not a fairytale and that I have to deal with my shit on my own and not bother anyone else. 
But I am fucking tired. I can't anymore. Because of having broken up my partner, I realized the incredible amount of self-esteem issues that I have because of all I've gone through, and I just know that I need help. Every day I wake up is a living hell. My mind just won't leave me alone and I don't know what to do to stop it. 
I know that having the amount of time and resources to go to therapy and to start working out will help me feel better, but I can't do neither of those things because of her. Because she wants to control my life to such degrees, she doesn't even let me decide for myself. Because she thinks she knows me better than I know myself. 
I tried to talk to her multiple times, but she gets very verbally violent with me and physically threatens me. Everyone around me agrees that it's her holding me back and pushing this overwhelming amount of pressure on top of me, but I don't think I have the courage to go against her because I'm really afraid of her. She holds power over me not only psychologically but money wise. However, I am not underage anymore, so technically I'm an adult in the eyes of the law. 
So, I just don't know what to do. I don't know if I should just hold on until this school year passes and then do another degree or just run away as far as I can and start over. 
I just want some fucking peace.",1
test_pid_523,I gonna meet my psychologist for the first time next week. What can I expect? : I went to my GP a couple weeks ago because I'm depressed and I cut myself pretty often so she said I gonna need a psychologist but what kind of questions can I expect because I'm nervous as fuck,1
test_pid_524,"Can depression lead to psychosis? : I am missing time, like I am sure I was just sleeping, but for periods of between 15-25 hours I've just no recollection of what's happened. Maybe it's because I've been doing nothing, or nothing worth remembering, but sometimes I am really worried I have some kind of dissociation problem or like I end up in a weird state and then fall asleep, wake up and just assume I slept the whole time. If that's not the case and it's just paranoia, then it's still worrying because I am convincing myself of this fact. I turned my phone off for a couple of days earlier in the week, and ultimately ignored my family, work, and my therapist. Then I went back into work on Saturday and nothing felt right. I couldn't really remember what I did over the two days, and checking my internet history there's 15 hours of blank, between 2pm and 5am. I'd only woken up at 11am that morning so I couldn't have fallen back asleep after just 3 hours, right? So what happened in that 15 hours? 
I am no stranger to drugs and used to be addicted to various pills, but I stopped that, except I found some in my room in a baggie, I am sure they must have been from a long time ago because as far as I know I have not relapsed, but the tablets I found are consistent with blackouts. What if I found them, took them, and forgot? Am I even clean anymore? What if I am so far gone that I actually went out and got them and forgot? Then I really would be going insane. I threw the rest down the toilet and in the week since, I have no found anymore or missed any time, which is a relief. But anyway, on that Saturday I started convincing myself something was wrong. I'd missed a shift without calling in because I had fallen asleep for 21 hours (or so I hope I was asleep), and I'd been late earlier that week too. 
First I thought I was going to get fired. I had texted my boss after two days to say I am sorry I didn't respond, but that I was embarrassed for missing my shift and would explain later. When I came in, it's like he didn't know what to do with me, and put me on an easy department. I'd discussed with my friend and colleague on watsapp how my body was not used to the heavy lifting (I'd been on holiday for two weeks, and after my first week back I was really struggling to do the things I'd gotten used to- I work shelf stocking at a grocery store), and I'd told him I was used to certain areas. Suddenly my boss put me on those areas and the usual guy who did them, put him elsewhere. So I convinced myself he had read my messages with my friend. He was looking at ways to fire me. The colleague on the aisle near me kept coming round to do bits on my aisle, and I was completely convinced he was watching me. To this day i still think he was. In fact that whole day was off, and ever since my colleagues haven't been treating me the same, like they've all been let in on something that I don't know. Am I being investigated? Did my counsellor worry so much that she got in touch?
I kept overhearing whispers and people looking at me. Walking home that night I spotted several people driving past, people I never see. Three people offered me lifts, I even took a half hour detour scared out my mind there'd be people at my house ready to section me or something. I was having a full blown paranoid episode. And I swear I've never felt that way in my entire life. I've felt disconnected, almost like I'm not real sometimes, but never like that. I finally made my way home and my flatmate was there, by the door. Then I convinced myself she was in on it, whatever 'it' was, and I kept hearing the door going every 10 seconds and people talking or whispering. My two flatmates were downstairs watching tv together and they literally never do that. I kept locking my door every time I went to the bathroom because I thought maybe they were going to search my room. (For what? I have no clue). I still do this, even though it's been days. 
The next day was no better. The girl he normally puts on the aisle I was put on, was told she was going to take me off at 3am. I overheard this conversation with a colleague, but when I asked her if she was on there at all, she said no. This girl was then in the staffroom when my boss told me to go up and get my till code because I'd be on tills for a bit. So, naturally, I convinced myself she was up there spying to see what locker I had my bag in. I don't know where that idea had come from, but the night before, I had felt so confined by the fact that I was NEVER left alone, even on my breaks where I'd received texts like ""where did you go?"" when I went to the toilet, I 'escaped' when my colleague left my aisle, and ran upstairs to the toilet. As I came back down, I bumped into my boss, who had been nowhere to be found for an hour before that, and by bumped I mean literally bumped. As in he was running. He stumbled backwards onto the stairs. I laughed, and it's even funnier thinking about it now, but it was so foreign to me. Why did he happen to be running up the stairs like a minute after I'd gone up? Am I just making this all up in my head? 
I came out of my room yesterday properly for the first time in a couple of days and walked past my flatmate. I decided to actually speak to her because this whole paranoid running in and out thing, as well as not eating anything, was not helping. If I was going to get hospitalised I wasn't helping the issue by hiding out and locking my door and having the worlds quickest shower in case someone was trying to break in. So we spoke, and then we really spoke. For hours we chatted, and I felt so much better. I'd also gone for a long walk to my local park, and although I was convinced I'd seen the same car driving around and that the man with the dog was watching me, I had dismissed it by the end of the day. And am feeling a lot more able to do things today. I ate dinner yesterday, after realising I have lost almost a stone in the past month (13lbs). Then I have eaten today and had two decent sleeps in a row. No random pills, no missing time, and I have rearrange my therapy appointment and got my doctor to write a note for my missed shift last week.
It's terrifying to me to have these kind of paranoid thoughts. I've always been kind of a conspiracy sort of person, but never the sort of conspiracy that might involve myself. I see the world as a cold dark place sometimes but I've always surrounded myself with the warmth of my friends and family. So to be seeing as my friends and family and co workers plotting against me, or convincing myself I am hearing things etc. has been a new and scary place. I don't ever want to be that far gone ever again. The worst thing is I'm still not completely convinced I was imagining everything. There's 100% something up at work. Maybe it's just that they've noticed my erratic behaviour and that in turn is causing more. I've texted my boss on two occasions now asking for a sit down to chat about anything he might want to talk about, and in response he hasn't replied, and has been avoiding me, yet everybody else seems to be constantly around. God what a hellish experience. 
Could this be because of a depressive episode? Or worse? Maybe there really is something wrong. I'll let you know if I get sacked or something. Then my delusions may have not been delusions after all,haha.",1

test_pid_526,"I want to vent about my loneliness : I feel extremely lonely. I thought it was boredom at first, but then I realized it was loneliness. 
My schedule is different compared to my university classmates. At most I see them 2 to 3 hours a week while they see each other the entire day, everyday. That's not enough time for me to develop friendships or connections when I have about 5 mins to talk to people before class begins. Then I move on when class is over because I have to be at a different class and the cycle begins again.
Sometimes when I catch them during free time I become friendlier. Usually that ends when everyone has to leave to attend their different schedules. I smile, I laugh. Something feels missing about it though. I can talk, but I don't feel a strong connection. I feel like they just respond because they have to. There is no mutual understanding other than the superficial niceties that's expected of us.
Anyone just have a talk with a psychologist just to vent? Like I just want to release my frustrations on loneliness. But I don't think it will be the same. It's just paying someone who doesn't want to be there listen to me talk. I hunger for someone I can connect with.

When I read the chat history I would obviously feel kinda sad..like it's so long ago..and she's no longer the person in that chat history.. but when I just feel very lonely after days of feeling zero affection and life doesn't seem like it's going anywhere because I haven't really found a direction in life yet, that's when I feel the urge to read them, to kinda warm me inside and remember that I wasn't always this lonely, I used to have someone that I could share anything to, someone that's waiting for me to watch a movie together or play a game together, and for years, it felt like she became a part of me, that I could imagine her voice whenever I feel lonely that I now longer could after she lost interest at me for about a year now. 
Sometimes I think of how great it would be....if she could just come back and be part of my life again. All this misery that I been living with for about a year now would just go away, and life will be back to normal. The sun would actually feel like it's shining again, not just only feeling it on the surface but within me too. I would actually have something to look forward to again after a day of struggle as a person with Asperger's, and usually what I look forward to when I get home is to just get on the PC and play games or watch a movie with her.

I've become self concious, so much so that I've begun wearing makeup daily (which I never normally do/did) to lessen how bad my skin looks to others. my reaction was just a grim acceptance. like yeah, I get it, you don't think I look at myself every day and mentally abuse myself for my self-destructive habits?? I absolutely hate myself for it and I wish every day I wasn't like this, but here I am, never having any inch of self-control to stop it. 
I just need some advice. also a place to vent - I'm sorry to anyone who's read this, you don't have to reply but just being able to express my thoughts somewhere (moderately) safe is good for me right now. I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow thank god :)",1

No one asks if I'm okay... I can't concentrate, I hate myself and I hate how I look... I hate me for having a loving family and being the way I am.. I keep hearing voices. They tell me that I should be dead, that I shouldn't live anymore, that I can't eat nor sleep.. they are more powerfull than I am.. they win every time..

I’m so happy for them because they are talented and are incredibly hard workers. Just frustrated with myself. My stomach feels like it’s twisting up ready to swallow me. I’ve been in my room the past couple of years. I cut most people off or we stopped being friends. Not like I was popular to begin with. I can’t keep up with the people I admire(d) the most. I can only watch the birds fly and hope for wings. But still, I’m supposed to keep going. 
I didn’t sleep all night because I’m avoiding something in particular. It’s pathetic. I’m mean and irritated most of the time, I don’t say the right things or act appropriately. I’m simple and easily manipulated and easy to forget. And then I’ll be gone and that’ll be it. I feel more pressure because people believed in me and thought I could do something with myself but I didn’t and won’t. The person I wanted to be exists so I don’t feel like I can take up an important space. I just came to be because two people that hate each other acted selfishly.",1

So why expect me to be always understanding and calm. I also feel sad and hurt and angry. Others also do, so i just don't understand why is it that if i cry, shout or get angry, people always make a big deal out of it. Why is it always me who needs to keep myself in check. As if i am not allowed to make a mistake. I had enough of all this shit. I want to breathe.
When i try to confide to my family, they over react. When i tell my friends, they don't care. If i talk to my classmates, they always make it an issue. I just really need to get this out of my chest but i'm also tired of being judged.

Had gone through a break up (3yr relationship) end of last year but it was my choice meaning no particular sad or dramatic effects etc. Starting Viibryd, I was feeling good and I had energy to do things etc. And during this period had no real thoughts, sadness or appreciation for the past relationship. It felt like I was moving on but it was also like it never happened (if that even makes sense). I recently ended up stopping Viibryd cold turkey (maybe 2 weeks ago) - I still want to hang out with friends and have been social etc but I’ve also started having thoughts of how wonderful the relationship was and having my ex’s image in my head which I wasn’t having at all while on Viibryd. It felt like I was numb while on the medicine and now I’m not. Genuinely confused as to what’s happening and what’s even normal anymore. I feel like I could do with out the meds but am wondering if the ‘new correct me’ is how I feel on the meds. I keep reading online to make sense of this but find nothing.

Just a single cut on my knee so no one knows I'm cutting again (I've told my family about it cuz i thought I was getting better). Just a single cut to ease my nerves. Just to feel the stinging pain and seeing the blood seep out. I just want it. But it's summer here and it's too hot to wear long pants (I cut in my thighs) and shorts won't cover it properly. I JUST WANNA CUT AGAIN SO BADLY!!! I can't take it anymore! Everythings gone plummetting downhill in only a few hours. I'm currently listening to Home, by cavetown 1hr loop just like I used to when things got bad. I'm sitting here trying to cry and let it out but there are no tears. I don't know why it whenever I need to cry ill be shaking, sobbing, in the verge of screaming, but there are NO tears. But that doesn't matter. I still feel like dragging a blade over my skin. I could commit suicide right now. I live next to a main road. There's vars going over it constantly at high speeds. If I could just get hit. But then people will be sad I'm gone.

My anxiety and depression is literally debilitating and I wouldn’t wish this upon anybody. This is an everyday struggle for me from the moment I wake up to the second before I fall asleep. My mind feels like it thinks at 1000mph. 
I’m only 18 and it’s just so crazy to me that I go through so much deep emotional pain. It doesn’t seem normal. Why do I have to be so young going through so much? It really sucks and It’s so unfortunate that I have to live with this. It’s back and forth too, one moment I’m happy and life is amazing, and then the next I feel like the world is over. It’s a vicious cycle for me and I really need to figure it out. The fact that I have to go through almost desperate measures to feel like a normal human being is so frustrating. It does not come easy for me at all.
It gets really tough maintaining a happy image around my peers when deep down I’m struggling tremendously, but I’ve been doing this shit for so long that I just have no other option but to push through.

My dad was a severe alcoholic and my whole family struggled with that for so many years, and after several instances of trying to take his own life he finally got the help he needs and is doing so well with his recovery. It was only 2 years ago I truly realised how badly my mother was always behaving and how she was demoralising the family in her efforts to control, control, control.  My dad is off alcohol now, and has been for a while, but my mother refuses to admit that she's not well or that she is abusive. She sends him the most poisonous vile messages and threatens to leave with us kids all the time, and it's killing me. My dad has got bad heart problems and has had strokes, so he is not well in his body (or mind), but he works himself to the bone to provide for us, but my mother just sucks the enjoyment and life out of everything we do. They've had marriage counselling so many times, but it doesn't do shit. Mum still believes the problem is still dad, it's dad, it can't be anything else. Dad has said to me so many times about how's he's worried about what he's going to do, whether he'll pick up drink again pr actually mange to kill himself this time. School has just gotten a lot harder for me as well(15, so GCSE's), I'm usually a straight-A's student, but I can't concentrate, my grades are slipping, and I'm disappointing everyone who cares about me. I've mentioned to others about how I can't carry on but people just think I'm being dramatic or overreacting. My younger sister almost had a meltdown at school so she stayed with someone for 2 weeks but my mother just freaked out and blamed my dad. I can't get out of this pit, what can I do?

It's like every day I go to school I put on this mask and play a character for everyone's amusement. I do it because it paints this illusion that people actually like me cus they laugh at the shit I do but really they're making a joke out of me and think of me as ""the weird kid"". I have a small circle of about 10 friends and while I am able to act myself around them, I still feel outcasted cus they view me as the pushover of the group. They're always insulting me and physically abusing me but to them it's all just a bit of fun. There's been two occasions where I've decided to retaliate to my friends' abuse. The first time, my friend drenched me with a hose when we were hanging out in his backyard and so I responded by putting his jacket under a running sink. He then proceeded to punch me in the face until my nose was bleeding and I walked home, my clothes still soaking wet. The second time was when my friends took my hat during lunch and wouldn't give it back so I took one of their hats. The guy whose hat it was tackled me to the ground and punched me 4 times in the back of the head. Never even got my fucking hat back. It's not just physical abuse either, when my friend bought me lunch this one time I said I'd pay him back as soon as I could but apparently I was taking too long so my entire friend group decided I wasn't allowed to hang out with them on weekends until I'd paid back double the amount I originally owed. I've fallen into a deep depression and as a result my grades have plummeted drastically. Ive been told by teachers that if I don't sort out this problem I have to repeat year 10 or leave the school. The worst thing about all of this is that I take my anger out on my parents. We argue on a regular basis and my episodes often result in me punching holes in the wall or breaking stuff around the house. The worst argument me and my parents had ultimately led to me punching my mum in the arm, quite hard. I'm such a fucking shitty human being that i resort to breaking my parents shit and hitting my mum when I get mad. I fooled myself into thinking it's my parents' fault for all my life problems but now I realise all they want is for me to succeed and be happy. I treat good people such as my parents like shit because I dont wanna take blame for my own actions. I've now added drugs into the mix having done acid and molly several times as well as regularly smoking weed. I'm so sick of this stupid fucking life. I'm a shit stain on this planet I fucking hate myself and this world Im so sick and tired of everything.

I get this weird sadness inside my head whenever I'm alone or thinking too much, i don't why or what I'm sad about and I'm feeling like it is sucking out all the energy in me. I've been pushing people away from me recently, even if I'm simply sitting in my room and some one calls me to go out I lies and gets out of it. I've been doing this for a long time now, I'm not finding it rewarding going places. Later i regret about sitting home depressed. Also the fact that the life we're living is zero significance has struck me really bad I always feel like I'm so insignificant that people might not miss me even if I'm not present and I think that's why I'm pushing people out of my life and missing crowded gathering because of me feeling lonely or feeling like I'm being ignored. There's a lot of time I feel like there is no point in living this life but I'm too afraid to take my life also. The only think that's keeping me alive is the thought that me taking my life is gonna effect my parents and sister really bad.

But if you’re taking it and you have symptoms of depression it really could be contributing. I started taking the pill about a month before starting university so at first thought I was just homesick and unhappy and being out of my comfort zone. It wasn’t until over a year later that I saw an article that really made me think. I can’t describe the level of unhappiness I felt whilst on the pill. I would dread getting out of bed, gained a lot of weight from comfort eating, would cry at random points for no apparent reason and after a while had serious thoughts about killing myself. 
What I couldn’t understand is why because I felt like I had no reason to be unhappy. I had great friends and family, a loving boyfriend, I was doing well in my degree so why did I feel so low? It was only when I decided to stop the pill that I noticed how much better I felt in myself. It scares me what the pill did to me and what might have happened if I had stayed on it. 
So I just want people on the pill to be aware of what it does and how much research there is out there linking depression to the pill.

i also have adhd, which makes things so much harder to actually do. i feel like every class is a burden. i constantly fall back every time. i have no motivation for anything. i just curl up on my bed and lay there. i have some amazing friends but it’s already scary thinking about opening up to them with my own personal problems. 
and my family makes me feel the worst. since im the eldest sibling, i always had this expectation to do more. my depression gets in the way of everything and i want it gone. i get irritable and upset so quickly that even my younger siblings have noticed it. i feel like everyday, i’m letting everyone and everything down. like i’ll never succeed in any of the dreams and aspirations i have. if i’m going to constantly get stuck like this, what chances do i even have in the future?",1

test_pid_610,"Leaving Secondary School Has Made Me Depressed : PLEASE LISTEN
This needs to get off my chest, sorry reddit for having to bare this.
For background information, I was in a secondary school (UK) 11- 16 year old. In year 11 (my last year) I had a blast, I had at least 40 people who I knew well and got on with, I had a girlfriend in another school (who I’m still with), I had another 15 people out of school I seen EVERY weekend, and I had my science friends (who I didn’t see out of school ever, roughly 5 of them)
Year 11 was so so fun, me and my friends had so much fun in school and out of school, we went out every single weekend, it was so fun. We mixed with people from other towns as well. Then after GCSEs were done, and the new academic year started, I decided to stay at sixth form leaving me just with my science friends. Everyone else had gone to college or another sixth form. Don’t get me wrong I like my science friends but didn’t have that bond with them anything like my other close friends that left. What was once 40, is now 5. Yes I have 5 ‘friends’ left now, who I don’t even see outside of school. 
Not only that, but all of my close friends and the others from other towns have all drifted apart, stopped speaking as much and no one goes out anymore, it’s literally as if my life has declined dramatically since I started sixth form. Whenever we try and organise a get together it never works, no one will commit to it. So it isn’t even a case if I can still see my friends on the weekend, because I can’t. I still have 3 really close friends who I see often, but it’s not the same as socialising in one big group. Sixth form is a drag too.
I’m still with my girlfriend thank god, probs the only thing keeping me going, I see her a lot. But even then it’s not the same. She used to come out with everyone too and that was so much fun and we bonded so well. I can’t stress it was so good with everyone coming out and socialising but now it’s literally as if life has died and my social life has gone out of the window. I’m still doing sports but I do boxing, which is a lonely sport anyway. I know I can’t turn back the time but I needed this off my chest and any advice would be greatly appreciated, I don’t even wanna go uni because I’m very social and can suspect the people there will be like my ‘science friends’. It’s like I’m aimlessly and lonely living just for the sake of it, with no goal in site. No social life, and I miss my past life. Sorry reddit.
P.s. I never talk about my feelings, I’m very closed, never want to open up, EVER. But I can’t help it, it’s been like this for 6 months and not sure how long I can go.

test_pid_617,"Not sure what to do : I've been diagnosed with anxiety for many years now, but it's only recently that I've started to have suicidal thoughts. I moved to the place known as the UK nearly 6 years ago now, and if I'm honest, that's probably the point where my life started to turn south. I was quite shy and struggled to make friends (still struggle with that, but that's not the point) which probably caused me to feel alone, especially with my brother moving out and my parents never really there (at work). I really don't know what caused me to feel like this recently when I managed to cope with everything for years before this. It's having an effect on other stuff as well, mainly my grades, which is causing my parents to worry even more about me which I don't want them to be. Therapists I've been to have never really helped, but I don't think I can carry on trying to help myself while my physical and mental health deteriorates.",1

I texted a girl, but I didnt  enjoy any of that, now I just in my room empty, I cant get a feeling out of anythig, I might burn my legs a little so adrenaline rushes to my mind. Help, I dont know",1

I am depressed. It feels so weird when I type it down. I can't focus during classes, I end up mindlessly browsing reddit. I can't bring myself to do the work for class. I eat a lot. I feel a dread creep up on me every time I think about waking up tomorrow and *doing* thigs. I feel it when someone asks me what I'm doing this friday. I feel it when I think about the exchange I'm planning on going on next semester. 
I tell myself I will be ok, and I know I will, and people I talk about this with tell me the same, but it just doesn't feel like it. At first I thought it was a couple-day slump. Maybe the weather was getting to me. And then the days went by. The weather improved, small issues came and went, and yet I still couldn't get out of it. It's been more than a month now and I don't feel like it's changed; for better or for worse. I-can't-get-out-of-my-head is a phrase I couldn't really understand until these past few days.
Now here I am, trying to complete a damn essay for a damn class I don't even goddamn like. I'm writing this down in hopes that my brain kinda wakes up, reacts, acknowledges that I need to actually **do** something other than moap. Not jusst for the essay. For My family who hasn't really noticed. For my SO, who worries every time I bring this up. For my friends, who have problems of their own. Honestly, for myself, because I deserve better and I know I can be.

I mean it when I say fall, i could be doing really good but then I feel like I'm slipping then straight up falling into a hole, where I can't grab anything or anyone for support. Lately every time I fall it's been hitting harder. As I said I've been doing good despite going through some fucked up family stuff, but my bad days are scaring me. I feel less productive,skip meals, have a hard time taking care of myself, and go a while without talking to family and friends.

My parents don’t think my emotions are important, so I guess they wont care if I ended my life today. It wouldn’t affect them much because I’m complete shitless and useless to them.

Just talking with someone I dont know like going to a shop inorder to buy something makes me trembling! Sweating! Apathic! Shaking !(sometimes very noticeable which makes things worse)  
 That's fine ! I'm like this since i was born! But the worse is comming!
- since 2018 brutally! Without any special  raison  ( I was going back home after a painful tooth extraction )  suddenly I realized that I'm not able to focus anymore! After working very hard for my studies (I'm usually the 1st in my class/dont judge my English I'm not native)  I felt like a kept my intellectual raisonement but i cant use it more than 10mins after 10mins I have a terrible headache blurred vision , feel like I'm having a high body temperature, even shaking sometimes 
 I stopped going school from that day cause it was unsupportable for me!  
Sometimes I feel like a random pain /invalid/without an evident cause in my chest-back -arms and throat! Specially throat!
I'm having a sever forme of psoriasis  ! 
 I take an SNRI (venlafaxine/effexor) - benzodiazepines (lorazepam  etc..) -  for sleep purpose  a TCA (trimipramin/surmontil) +some morphinics which I strongly v been addicted too  before (tramadol/codeine /morphine) cause it makes me calmer ! 
 - I live in algeria (north Africa).. the health care system isn't well developed for carring abt cases like me ..+ I'm young  and my parents feels bad for me cause I entirely depends on them even if I dont talk abt my pains .. very rarly ..  I just say it's okay.

test_pid_648,"Hi, new in town : Hope I don't break any rules talking about this. I didn't find another sub mentioning it.
I need to come to terms with the fact I could have mild/functioning depression. I saw articles where it is called dysthymia.
When talking mental health I've always felt so small compared to cases much more extreme than mine.
Though, I think I'm not shooting towards some good in my life at the time being.
My career seems like a joke, I don't like it, and I certainly don't admire the people in upper management, don't want to replace them either. This industry was good while learning it in Masters degree, but now it just feels bland. Quality control and sales figures just killed it. As they would kill anything else I want to do. As a result, I don't feel proud of what I do at job, I just do it.
My hobbies are kind of on hold because there's no energy left to make them live after a day of work. Actually, at none of them I'm proficient, I'm just trying to educate myself. And these are so niche I don't find like-minded persons IRL. Internet has become my echo chamber. I've always had too much hobbies. I would not define them as copes, more like genuine interests I would avidly develop, given time to do so, without worrying too much about money earnings.
My girlfriend is supportive, but she's supporting me in the wrong way, saying things like ""you're killing it at job, you will be a great executive later""; which I don't want to hear. I would have loved hearing I will become a good music composer.
But that's wrong because people who've done art stuff since childhood with parents' support, are miles ahead from me and I cannot get the kickstart I'd wish : time off + art school or student life. Because I need to pay the damned bills.
My family was dysfunctional due to a hateful divorce between my parents, it took 20 years and it's still not over.
I seldom get extremely dark thoughts because I keep myself busy, but this existence holds no good future as long as I have to finance an average lifestyle with an average job, living a life that's not really mine.
I am angry at society because there are a number of ways to ""heal"" from depression there, but the only one that truly works is not allowed. The cure is : finding a meaning to life again, and not encountering unconquerable obstacles. I consider my bank account an unconquerable obstacle. Paying really is an overrated action, if you will hear me.
Thanks for reading up. I  may not disturb you any longer. Good luck to all the people over here who have it harder.",1

I’ve been a sexual assault survivor and since then my depression has hit dangerous levels. I’ve been diagnosed with ptsd and borderline bipolar disorder..I’m losing motivation for everything I used to love. I recently lost about 40 pounds due to diet/exercise and you’d think the healthy lifestyle would be something that helped but at this point all it created was an eating disorder. I’ve tried therapy I tried self medicating with cannabis but then everyone says I’m like a zombie. But when I’m high I actually feel feelings. I don’t want to rely only on cannabis anymore. But sometimes my anxiety and depression have been such an issue I can’t sleep. I went 32 hours without sleep and I had to force myself to sleep.

I want to talk to them so badly. I want to tell them how lonely I am, or how I feel, but I don’t want them to feel bad for having friends, I don’t want them to feel bad for not talking enough because I can see they make a large effort and I’m the one who can’t seem to accept that as enough.
And what’s more, is that they’re also depressed. Their problems seem so much worse than mine, which just creates this barrier. They talk about their daily problems quite frequently, so I never have much opportunity to talk about mine. I guess the best way to put it is that I crave some form of attention, even just the minimal amount would be enough. I don’t really know though, my mind is an utter mess most of the time anyway.",1

test_pid_661,"I don't know what to do :  
Im 23, soon to be 24. Married and just had our first child in October. I love my wife and I love my daughter. However, i hate every other aspect about my fucking life.
I joined the military when I was 17 to get away from family. I met my wife and got married when I was 19. I have no regrets about that whatsoever. I got out of the Navy after 4 years because I despised it. I hated the long hours, I was an aircraft mechanic and hated that job. I couldn't stand going on deployments, constantly getting shitted on by management and co workers, the constant disrespect. I hated all of it, but i just kept looking forward to the year 2018, as I knew it would all be over. So after getting out, we moved back to my wifes home state of Maryland.
Ever since then it has gotten extremely worse. I am a full time student and work full time, and now with the new baby. I am extremely broke and since moving here in 2018, have accumulated over $15k in debt with the number still going up. I have to be full time in college in order to get government assistance to pay rent. If i went more than 2 months without it we would be evicted.
I have absolutely no friends due to living in a new state. I have hung out with people other than family once since 2018.
I drive over an hour and a half to work each way, come home and do homework for 2-4 hours a day, sleep and repeat. I pay over $1700 in rent and my house was a downgrade from my previous. I had to sell a car because we could not afford payments. I only see my parents and brother 2 or 3 times a year. And any time i bring any of this up to my wife she just calls me pessimistic and negative.
I am at the point that I cry weekly due to how shitty this is. I cannot remember the last time I truly was able to make a decision on my own other than to leave the military (which was the whole reason I got out to begin with TO LIVE MY LIFE). I have no one to turn to, no time for a hobby, no friends to talk with. I just do not know what to do....",1

test_pid_669,"After isolating, I feel awkward reconnecting. I need help. : This is going to be a bit of a long post, but I want to give some context: 
I've struggled with depression my (34F) entire life. There are periods where my depression is debilitating (complete loss of appetite for months, suicidal ideation, getting out of bed in the morning takes every last ounce of energy) and there are times where it is completely functional and I feel okay. I had a very bad downswing that started in the fall of 2018, got a little better in the spring, got really bad again over the summer, and then became pretty unbearable in November of 2019. I'm only just starting to feel better after working with my doctor trying to find a medicine that works for me and starting to work with a therapist again.
One of the ways depression hit me was that it made me want to isolate myself from my loved ones. I was not only ashamed of how I was feeling, but I was just really exhausted from pretending like everything was okay around other people. Basically, I stopped responding to calls and texts unless I needed to respond (like to coworkers). 
One of the people I isolated myself from was one of my best friends, whom I've known since college. I know that this is one of the people I should have felt comfortable talking to about my struggles. Her mother-in-law, however, has also struggled with depression. I've listened to my friend make comments about her MIL such as ""I wish she would just snap out of it,"" ""She is in control over her own mood, so it's her fault she feels this way,"" and ""I just don't understand depression. People should just get over it."" It's made it very difficult for me to be able to open up to her about what I'm going through. 
So I stopped responding to calls, texts, etc. and obviously she has stopped reaching out to me. I don't blame her. Now that I'm starting to feel some slight relief in my symptoms, I'm wanting to reach out to her again. I feel really bad that I can't bring myself to do it. It's been over a year since we've talked. I feel embarrassed, and I feel like it warrants an explanation. I feel extremely bad about it now, because she recently announced that she is pregnant (I found out through Facebook). She was having a really hard time getting pregnant and she's always wanted a baby, so this is REALLY important to her. I recently got an invitation to the baby shower (I think that might be too much for me) but I do want to reach out and congratulate her and maybe connect in person but one-on-one, but I feel stuck. Thanks to anyone who read this far. Has anyone else experienced something similar or have any advice for me?
TL;DR: I became extremely depressed, isolated myself from everyone including my best friend who has made disparaging comments about depression, but not I want to reconnect but am feeling too embarrassed and stuck to do so. Halp.",1
test_pid_670,"An important personal experience with medication : Hi everyone, this is lengthy, but I feel like it's a very important thing to read for those newly seeking help or who are having issues finding what works for them. 
I'd like to start by saying this: I've struggled with depression since I was very young, and never sought the help I desperately needed. I told myself ""I've got this"", ""it won't work for me"", and the usual excuses not to seek help. I went well over a decade without doing anything about it, went through the suicidal thoughts (those still exist, please keep reading) and I was told by many to get help, but I just never could get myself to actually do it. 
While I was loud and proud with my struggles, making jokes, etc. I was too embarrassed to tell a professional. I don't know why, but I just thought they'd give me a hard time or not take it seriously. 
I've never been taken very seriously by a doctor for a lot of my life, but after seeing my newest PCP consistently for about 9 months and feeling a level of comfort and trust, I decided on a whim to mention it. He diagnosed me with clinical depression, and I was placed on zoloft. My stomach hated me for that, and I spent 3 months on the toilet consistently. My head felt a bit more clear, and I knew medication had side effects, so I figured it was normal and that was the balance (god was I wrong). Finally, I told him, so round 2, we went with lexapro. I felt awesome. I had energy again. I was talkative and engaging in social behavior again, but this is where it gets interesting.
On top of all these pleasant feelings, I had a new set of problems. My anxiety ramped up tenfold. My suicidal thoughts became even more serious, and I began making random, impulsive, mid-priced purchases ($300-500). Didn't really even think about that much, I just thought ""I'm feeling good for once, to hell with it!"". I opened 3 new credit cards within a 4 month period.
So, why am I telling you that part? Well, due to my severely increased anxiety and suicidal thoughts, a friend of mine noticed something she saw in her brother, and told me I need to go to a psychiatrist immediately, because she thinks there's something else wrong. She expressed why she felt this way, and how seriously this needs to be taken, and that I'm scaring her and everyone else. So, I did.
A couple weeks later, I go to my appointment, and I come out with a completely different diagnosis- Bipolar II. I was placed on Lamictal, and within a week, the fog was lifted. I felt such relief. I began therapy, and I'm here now, a couple months later, and I'm fixing the damage done while on improper medication.
The moral of the story here is, if you have problems and your first step that you feel comfortable with is to tell your primary care doctor, that's absolutely fine- but monitor yourself. See what gets better, and if other things get worse, and make note of them. Otherwise, you may find yourself $7k in debt and damaging everything and every relationship you have, without ever realizing what you're doing. I empathize with all of you here, I know what depression does to you. I suffered for so long, and I'm finally on a road to recovery. There's no shame in speaking to a professional about what's happening, and I can't express this enough (and don't take this the wrong way) If you think help won't work for you - try it anyway. You have nothing to lose, and you may find that you're not as special as you think you are. It works for a lot more people than it doesn't work for. You're more likely to be the statistic of those it does work for. Keep at it. Please.

Things would be going great in life but I would somehow always find something to be bothered by.  As for most people, my life has been full of a lot of ups and downs.  When my girlfriend left me about a year ago, I thought that I had hit rock bottom emotionally.  I had to take some time off from work to get my mind straight, I saw a therapist for a while.  A lot of people assured me that I would bounce back to my good old self soon enough.
I’ve always been a creative person.  I love to write music.  I’ve worked in the food &amp; beverage business for a long time, and I loved being able to create new concoctions.  My job allowed me a bit of creativity, however my boss would begin to shut down a lot of my ideas and would direct more and more negativity my way.  I decided a long time ago that I would one day want to work for myself.  I’ve envisioned myself running a bar or a restaurant maybe, and how miserable I was at my current job.
Well now I have been unemployed for about 10 days &amp; that motivation I used to have is just not there.  I just lay in bed all day browsing Reddit &amp; YouTube, sometimes getting up to make a snack or play video games.  Sometimes I will go to the store for groceries.  Sometimes I will meet my mother for lunch on Sunday, but aside from those things I haven’t left the house at all really.
I used to have all kinds of friends to go do things with, and now that’s not really a thing, and even if it were, I don’t know that I would want to go do much.  A cute girl has been trying to get together with me, but I politely decline and make up excuses.  I feel like I don’t have anything to offer anyone in a relationship right now, and that’s ok, as I’ve decided that I want to focus on ME for a little while md get my career &amp; mental health sorted out.  
I used to have these cool creative ideas all the time and would often think to myself “oh I wish I had the time to get these projects started.”  Now that I have nothing but time, I have zero drive or energy.  I’m always procrastinating and saying “oh I’ll get started tomorrow” and then tomorrow comes and I just lay in bed until I get hungry at 6PM and decide to turn on the PlayStation, at which point I will probably play until 4AM, get in bed and watch TV for two hours until I finally fall asleep.

I can’t open my heart. I don’t know how to get truly close to someone. Nobody knows who I am or what I feel. I just don’t know how to receive what I want most in this existence. I feel like my heart is blocked. I can’t even cry anymore I just feel numb. 
I’m starting to not care. If I have to go through this life by myself I would rather not exist.  I hate being alone with myself. I don’t even know who I am. 
All I want is for someone to want me. I just can’t take the emptiness anymore I so badly want someone to want me. 
I feel like my mind is broken and I’m ok with it. It’s like I don’t even care
Dec 4th 2019. 
I’m stuck.  I hate waking up everyday. I have no one. Please god just give me someone that will love me. I feel so disgusting and ugly I hate being this way. I just want someone to hug me and want me. Never in my life have I actually been wanted by a girl. It makes me feel so inadequate. I’m 20 years old I’ve never been in a relationship. It’s like I don’t even know who I am. When I get sad about it it just immediately turns into a numbing feeling of nothingness. Like I don’t even care anymore. Like I am accepting defeat. I so badly want someone to care about me in only a way that a girl can. I feel like I’m going to live the rest of my life without it. And to be honest I’d just rather not live in that case. Why was I born? For what? I have nothing,no one. If only I knew what happens when i die. That’s the only reason I’m still here. Because even though I hate this life it still might be better than what’s next. 
Feb 10th 2020 
Here I am. I still feel the same. If not worse. I just feel nothing now. Like every time I think of my life I just feel blank, like nothing. Like I don’t care. I do not care. I don’t know what I’m doing, Why I am doing anything., or Why I am here. Does everyone feel this way?  Because if they do I don’t know how they do it. I already have to numb myself with weed or alcohol on a daily basis just to function. 
I hate being in my head alone. I so badly and I can’t stress it enough so BADLY want someone to want me. I am truly alone. I hate it. I’d be so happy if someone wanted me. I guess I’ll just keep existing for now.",1

test_pid_692,"[Motivation]Depression is a monster and you have to be one to survive it : Here's the sad truth about all living creatures, not everyone is born equal or even capable of surviving in this world as they currently are. Sometimes we are born into situations that doom you to a life of misery and pain. There are so many people in this world suffering, life is not fair, and nature is trying to kill us on a daily basis. 
No matter what life is going to throw its an incomprehensible amount of tragedy, hardship and wounds your way, everyone you will ever know and love will leave or die. You will lose everything that you have in this. In order to survive you most be able to sustain mortal wounds and massive losses, sometimes on a daily basis, because that's just how cruel this world is. 
Depression is a monster and its goal is not to handicap you, its aim is to kill and you must become a monster to fight a monster. If you are reading this, then that is a testament to the strength that is deep within you. Human beings have evolved for millions of years in order to get this far and experienced much more brutal circumstances, just because you never developed your dark side doesn't mean it isn't there.  We must not give into our fate, we have to rage until the dying of the light. 
Be prepared for the greatest fight of your life, it doesn't matter how hopeless the situation is, if you are going to die, which we all will sooner or later, let's die fighting and show life that we will not be easy prey. 
Once you accept your death, it will be easier to move despite the suffering you experience; the anxiety, the pain and your inadequacies will cease to be your sole focus. 
One last thing, be prepared to lose or relinquish any attachments you hold on to. It is not uncommon that many of the beliefs, objects, desires, or people we hold on to that we believe to help us survive in this world actually become the root cause of our suffering. Its like as Nietzsche said ""you must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame; how could you rise anew if you have not first become ashes?""",1
test_pid_693,"Extreme depression : I'm at that point where I've whined unceasingly about the causes of my depression and no closer to having alleviated those causes thus I must accept my reality.
But I just can't. It's like someone telling you to believe an object is yellow when really it's purple but no one will listen. You are forced to accept it as yellow. 
So for example you are in poverty and can't get employment no matter how hard you try. You know in your heart that you deserve better, that this circumstance was not ""supposed"" to happen, as though it were some error in fate.
You don't feel free. You feel like a prisoner and no one will help you. You have no friends. Nobody cares what happens to you ever again for the rest of your life.
What do you do? Or rather what should I do since these are my perceptions of myself? What can I do to change my situation? Is there any option other than acceptance?",1
test_pid_694,Bloody tears : I have a bad habit of picking at my wounds. Today I stood in front of the sink after brushing my teeth clawing at a wound. Blood started leaking out and it dried on my fingers. In an effort to try and boost my spirits and distract myself I looked in the mirror and smiled. I liked to think I was good and putting on the happy act. That people couldn’t tell what was wrong if I didn’t want to let them in. It doesn’t work the way it used to. Something else is broken now. All I could see was sadness in my eyes and in sucked me into this infinite loop of despair I was trying to avoid. I watched the tears form and fall down my face. God I hate my face. I watched the tears rise over the hills of my cheek bones and slip into the cavern of my lips never to be seen again. I went to wipe my face and had forgotten about the blood.

test_pid_699,"34/M - Sharing my story. Freedom from severe depression! : Hello everybody. I just wanted to share my personal experience with major depression in the hopes that I may provide some inspiration, motivation to those that are struggling! This will be long, I would prefer not to summarize things!
For nearly two decades, I had major depressive disorder - I felt completely overwhelmed by my depression. It ate up all my mental (and physical) energy, like a vampire within my own mind that I felt I couldn't get rid of. This affected my self-worth, lowered my self-image, and made me feel ashamed to interact with other people, because I was ashamed of myself, and I didn't want anybody to see that part of me. Therefore, I spent a lot of time isolating myself from others and have had very few close friends that I felt I could be truly honest with.
I saw numerous counselors, psychiatrists, life coaches, psychoanalysts, you name it. I tried 12 different medications, and I even had 52 neurofeedback sessions spread out across 4 months. I was determined to become free, to live a better life. During those nearly two decades, I would try a new therapist, or new medication, or new workout routine, or new diet - and in the beginning, it wouldn't work out the way I expected. Often, I would find that most things just ""covered up"" the depression, but didn't help permanently dissolve it. This led to a (seemingly) never-ending cycle of building the courage to not lose hope, try something new to treat the depression, become discouraged or disillusioned that it wasn't working, then fall back into feeling victimized by my depression and retreating into social isolation, using drugs, masturbation, unhealthy food and other distractions as a placeholder for my sadness.
As I continued trying new treatments for the depression, even if it didn't work out the way I anticipated, with each new go,  I was unconsciously feeding energy to a very distant part of myself - a self that had the will to be more, to feel and share joy with others. It was the pure, innocent and loving part of myself that had been buried by the momentum of nearly two decades of negative beliefs, thoughts and physical acts. Ultimately, in choosing to keep going and not give up, I was also choosing to acknowledge and listen to this part of my self. As a result, I was gradually ""chipping away"" at the depression - making it more and more manageable, and less pervasive in my mind. Although again, I wasn't conscious of this at the time.
I just want to let anyone reading this know that I GENUINELY felt for the longest time that I was going to be depressed forever. I couldn't see a way out and thought of killing myself nearly every day of my life. And yet - as I am typing this, I am experiencing more mental freedom then I could have ever imagined. I would not be experiencing this if I had given up. I chose to keep going, even though I was afraid that I would fail again and become even more discouraged. Eventually, I found the right therapist, the right medication, I discovered neurofeedback, and things began to ""click"" for me. It was NOT an instant process, again it was gradual.
I can see now that my depression was just like a computer program that was projecting the same negative thoughts, beliefs into my mind. I realized that any specific belief or thought that REPEATS in my mind is NOT me - the true being that I am is a creative being. I also realized that how I feel at any given time is directly correlated with whether or not I have allowed these negative programs into my mind. But I CAN separate myself from these thoughts - I can detach myself from these thoughts, I do NOT have to let these thoughts in. I can let them die, until the depression machine loses its stored energy, and thus loses its power over my mind and how I feel.
Once I started becoming more and more conscious of this - I could detect the negative thoughts in my mind as they appear, and rather than being passive and allowing them in, or choosing to identify myself with these thoughts, I could go into a neutral state and instead choose to reject them. Then, I could more easily tap into my positive, loving, optimistic self. It's a lot like changing the channel to better one on a TV, except in my mind.  
Although I am still struggling from time to time, the depression is WAY less prominent, and I have so much more hope and faith that things will get better. And if I can do it - considering how hopeless I used to think things were, feeling like I was in a black hole of despair with no escape, and how many mistakes I have made that fed the depression - then I truly believe that everybody has the capacity to do it. It's a process, of course... but the journey of a hundred miles begins with the first step!",1
test_pid_700,"I realized something very early in life : At first i was so optimistic but then it turned into hoping that if i said the opposite of what I wanted the thing that i wanted would happen but then it turned into saying what i wanted then immediately thinking or saying that it probably wasn't going to happen because that is just how life is and not it's just ""uuugggg i hate life"" or ""I'm going to go die now"" mostly because i know that anything i do will make my life go completely to shit and i am only 14",1

The bad thing is, is that I want to be happy, I just dont want the anxiety that comes with it.",1
test_pid_702,Its just a normality : Am I depressed? Honestly I dont ever know. I have felt like this for such a long time it has become my normal. Waking up everyday and wanting to quite. Holding back the tears talking to my parents. Hating every aspect of my life. Even the good aspects I find no happieness in. I constantly want to curl up in a ball and hide. Avoid the world. It sounds so peaceful. I could just sit and cry by myself. Alone hidden from the world with just my thoughts both dark and bright. Im ready to give up. Im ready for it to be over. I keep looking into the future thinking it will get better and this singular thought is what keeps me going. The problem is if I look into the past it has only gotten worse. The days were my body feels numb continue to rise. My mind seems to be constantly distant from my body as if my body means nothing. I go through days on autopiolet. It seems as if I wake in my bed and all of the sudden Im back in my bed about to fall asleep. Everything in my life is a blur with no substance. Its become impossible to focus. Simple task seem monumental and still I have no energy to accomplish them. I feel like Im about to just fade into space and become nonexistant. Why do I have to live like this? It sucks. Everyday sucks. I just want it to change. I want to be happy so bad but it seems impossible. A good life is something I have given up on.

Apologize for any formatting issues, I'm on mobile and I'm not thinking super clearly so this might be jumbled. 
I'm having the toughest year of my life and I'm really struggling to see how everything is worth it. I've been struggling with depression on and off for about 10 years now. I tried to kill myself when i was 12. But I've never gone to get help and my parents never took me to talk to anyone, they never knew I tried to kill myself and when I brought up mental health issues they just told me I was going to be fine. Last year, my mom (who has a million medical issues, and who died and was revived in front of me when I was 7) almost died (again) in the hospital because she got septic shock. Then a couple of months later my parents got into this bad fight where they dragged us all into it and the divorce bomb was dropped. It sounds stupid but it was traumatic because it felt like my family was being ripped apart both times in different ways. Between that, being overworked and highly stressed, it felt like a breaking point for me mentally. The next week all of a sudden they were fine and back together and everything was fine but I didn't feel fine anymore. 
I've been doing so many impulsive things I regret in the 8 months since that, Ive been making mistakes left and right, hurting people, and doing risky things for no reason the last couple of months. I got a divorce, I fight with my loved ones every time we talk now. I joined college but I have no motivation and I'm failing classes. I have a new boyfriend and the relationship makes me really happy but other than that I'm really struggling in all areas and I DO NOT want to be someone who only finds her happiness from a relationship.
I had a really bad day and a fight with my sister and I'm considering checking myself into the hospital for help. But I'm terrified. I don't want them to treat me badly, I don't want to end up stuck in there against my will, I don't want to go and not get help and it all be pointless. I finally got health insurance recently after not being to the doctor in more than 5 years. But it was over a month wait for my primary care. Its still two weeks before I can see her plus however long it takes to get bloodwork and referrals and shit afterwards. I feel overwhelmed and like i cant wait that long for help.
Can anyone tell me what would happen if I checked in to a hospital? Or what I should do? I feel like I need immediate help but I don't want to get trapped in the hospital without being able to leave or something and it was always drilled into my head that's what happens if you ever go to psych. 
Someone help, please?",1
test_pid_705,"Just tell me i don’t deserve this : I frequently and more or less randomly feel transported back to some undefined moment around 5 or 6 years old probably, just watching the sunset and wondering vaguely about what life will have in store for me (and all of us, really).
And the next moment it’s like I’m waking up from a nightmare, panicking and not even knowing why, and it turns out for almost 30 years i wasn’t in control of everything going on because i was asleep the whole time, having the nightmare.
And then I’m scared and everyone is worried and taking on collateral damage and i hate myself for it and then i realize how awful that is and then I’m angry at the unfairness of it all but it’s too late the anger has spilled over and I’m ruining things for no good reason and beyond exhausted.
I don’t know if i can ever get any comfort from deciding if what happened when i was 5/6 years old was the start of the nightmare, or if i was doomed before it even started.
I guess if I decide that I was doomed anyway then it’s a little easier to be a little less angry, but then there’s nowhere/no one to focus the anger on to, except Life itself, and then feeling like an idiot because I can’t deal with Life but then right back to being angry at any one who would dare suggest that when they haven’t had to live my life.

So after a minute of crying, I just stopped I'm guessing its the shut down coping mechanism I have (I assume). After some minutes went by I looked at myself in the mirror, at first I wasn't even sure if I was looking at myself... ""is that me"" I thought, but it's like I didn't recognize myself, for some reason I looked taller and that when I moved it seemed like the mirror wasn't completely in sync like the mirror was slower than me, I never felt that before I don't know what's wrong with me",1

I 21f, Am feeling rattled after this last therapy session. I’ve been contemplating suicide and am in a bit of a crisis. But this therapy sessions made things worse. I go to my intake session today and it was really uncomfortable. First he starts talking about if I was a pedo it doesn’t really count if I have magazine photos of kids in underwear. And I was like okay No I don’t. Then his first question was have I ever been sexually abused. And when I said no he asked if I’ve ever had sex black out drunk. After asking me if I self harm he proceeded to suggest I try bdsm, unprompted. I did not bring up sex. He isn’t a sex therapist. I actually have no libido so I was really cringing at this. He also suggested I go on sugar baby websites so I can go to shows or the opera. And kept talking about how alcohol was a turn off for him. And how I was a pretty girl. I’m really reserved so I didn’t say anything but I was super uncomfortable especially when he was talking about his turn offs and suggesting I go out with older men for money. Sex isn’t an issue for me and I’m not sure why the whole session was focused on it.",1

test_pid_729,"Not even sad anymore, just feel nothing always : I've (24M) come to an odd place in my depression that kinda has made it worse for me. Throughout my life I've aways been somewhat hyper aware of my own emotional state, as my emotions have always been something which I've felt incredibly intensely. 
When I was younger 17-19 I was very lonely and had a hard time connecting with others, this grew into something I came to recognized as situation depression. I had always believed I would feel truly better if I made those important social connections in my life. Eventually I did, I found myself in a strong circle of friends, working towards my life goals, and in love for the first time in my life with an amazing girl. This truly made me content, my depression went away and for the first time in my adult life I knew what it was like to be happy and proud of myself. this lasted about 2-3 years (19-22) and made me believe that it was possible to live a happy life. 
Slowly and one by one I began to lose the things that were important to me. My family moved across the country while I was in school and our relationships soured, my girlfriend moved away, we tried long distance but it wasn't what she wanted, she ghosting me and started a new life, my best friends slowly started to move away, change for the worse (lots of drugs and alcohol involved) or leave, one of my best friends passed away, and I started to fail out of school. All of this put me into the darkest hole ive ever been in and to be honest im not sure if I've ever fully recovered. 
(22-23) I can remember the most intense and excruciating sadness of my life, physically it felt like this vast aching hollowness inside of my chest and stomach that would never ever go away. Like the deepest blackest pit I could imagine had replaced the spot where my heart used to be ... 
Over the next two years (23-24) things began to turn around and my life improved. I turned my grades around after about 4 horrible wasted semesters, I started a new relationship, met some new people who became my friends, and I started working again after a long break. But truthfully I never felt content the way I used to and I'm still not the same. 
I dont truly connect with friends anymore and feel distant to everyone around me. I've now graduated from school finally with my BA after 6 years and moved back to my hometown, I dont keep in touch with my newer friends and only really talk to my girlfriend who ive been with for 2 years now (we're doing long distance now and its hard). Sometimes I honestly dont feel the capacity to love someone anymore and it puts an incredibly heavy strain on my relationship with her, I feel she deserves better than that and she always have. But the truth is I dont feel anything anymore, its just blank numbness every single day and night of my life. Im trying to get past it, im trying to better and love what I still have and what Ive made for myself but I still feel so utterly empty and void of emotion, its almost like thats the best emotionally I can do for myself and ive just come to except it.
Im about to turn 25 now, Im looking for full time jobs, staying active with exercise, I am sober since the new year and trying my best in my relationship but still feel profoundly empty.

I thought that if I had a job, a girlfriend, money, the things I want, then I would be happy as fuck. Well, I got a job. First months felt great. I could get anything I wanted. I did. I love photography and movies. So I got myself a DSLR. 
I went to work. My co-workers liked me because I was joyful not because I had a brand new job, but because I was always like that to other people. I like smiling, socializing, making them laugh. 
Then years after, I loved someone. She didn't want me but kept seeing each other because we are in a tiny county and we don't have an oppurtinity to meet new people. We always have to see each other. 
I decided I didn't want to talk to her. Because we spent a lot of time together at work and outside of work. Like we were lovers. So it was killing me. 
She's maybe the reason but I got my life in order. I exercise, started reading books again, I got myself a midi-keyboard and making music, playing video games for fun, writing, socializing... 
But the fact that she doesn't love me back, I still do these things. I still look after myself. Want to improve myself. For what? I don't know. But I feel like if I don't do this, I'll break down. Because I have to hold on to something.
This is not a love pain. This is not about love. But loneliness. I was rejected many times. Holy fuck they rejected me almost everytime. I don't think I am ugly or a jerk or a monster. They hurt, yes, but they didn't hurt me like this time. 
I feel useless. I feel tired. Whatever I do is just a rememberence that I can be a normal person. If I'm not busy with something, then I start thinking. Suicidal thoughts are coming to say hi. I'm not going to suicide that I know. Because jesus man, what the fuck? Who wants to do that if they are given a chance to live a good life. I said I was a dreamer. Still I am. Because I have hope. But it's fading day after day. 
People say what a good guy I am. But if I want to get closer to someone for a relationship, I might be the unluckiest, disgusting, inadequate fucker. I feel like I'm cursed. Because I want to share everything about my life, even a tiny fragment of my mind. I'd love to share them. 
But those people don't want to. 
I love smiling. I love making jokes. I love living. But I don't want to do this way. I'm missing. I miss something.",1

test_pid_762,"Questioning My Sanity : I've fallen into the usual slump during the colder seasons. I feel heavily demotivated and as a result I've stopped attending lectures. My self care decreases during this time, as well. I also depersonalize much more than usual, often blanking out in the middle of doing an activity and being less engaged during any social interactions. Usually this is all tolerable and I can pick myself back up quickly, but it has been increasingly difficult to bounce back because of what I've learned about my ""friends"" that I live with.
First off, I just want to say that my friends have introduced me to a lot of new things about fashion, video games, etc. and are pretty cool and funny people. I know I'm not extensively close with them, but they're enjoyable to be around and I thought pretty well of them.
Anyways, because the walls are so thin in my apartment, I can hear every conversation that occurs in the next-door rooms, as well as in the living room and kitchen. Usually this isn't a problem because I just put on some headphones and drown out the noise while I'm in my single room. But, unfortunately, when my roommates assumed that I wasn't able to listen in on their conversation in the living room, I overheard them making fun of me. 
The first time I thought it was just a joke and didn't make a big deal out of it. Over time, though, I noticed that they constantly talked behind my back and always made fun of me and talked shit about me. I also realize that they do the same about other people. They've started to make fun of me about how I don't talk to them and that I only laugh every now and then and call me a ""talk-show host"" to my face. I've never once responded to any of their snide remarks, but it has become increasingly overbearing for me to handle. 
Some days I wake up to them talking shit about me and some nights I sleep to the same thing. My anxiety has substantially increased, I've minimized my social interactions with them (and, as a byproduct, with many other friends), and my self care has been fucked as of late (sleeping schedule ruined, diet not as healthy, hygiene is poor). 
It took me a while to realize my so-called friends that I'm living with are kind of assholes. And I'm potentially living with them next year. Anyways, I feel way more depressed and way more anxious in social situations nowadays and I don't know what to do.

All I can see when I look back is contempt at my thoughts and actions. Sure, it was partially because of my worldview, but, yeah, I wasn't cut out. As I sit here, I feel the dull echoes of pain as memories cause mental scars to resonate.

test_pid_780,"Are you ever envious of openly depressed people? : This is definitely a weird subject to talk about for obvious reasons, but I feel like I should still post this anyway.
Sometimes I get jealous of people who are openly depressed or don't hide that they are depressed. I don't mean people who don't bother putting on a smile for the day, I mean people who will discuss their mental illness or make jokes about it. It's probably a pretty asshole way for me to think but I don't always think that way, just sometimes.
One of the biggest reasons I feel this way is because people I know who don't hide their depression joke about it constantly and are really uneducated on the illness. Sometimes that leads to me feeling like they aren't actually depressed but that's not in any way my place to talk because I don't know what goes on in their heads. But it definitely does annoy me as they just make the illness a quirk or a personality trait instead of something that ruins lives. 
I get jealous because these people are offered support instead of me. Which is disgusting of me and I realise that. I'm super happy for these people and glad they get help. Just sometimes I wish I had people worrying about me too. 
I'm jealous because they are the first to 'come out' about the illness or feeling and if I chose to then I'm just jumping onto the trend. Not that it's a trend but I don't want to be looked at that way. 
More of a personal example happened a few weeks ago. I was in class and my thoughts were swirly, I wanted to kill myself then and there. Adding to that I couldn't handle everyone's noise so I ran out of the room and spent the rest of the period hiding in the toilet. I then received a good old lecture about how my problems are insignificant and that I was being immature. Now there's a girl who goes to my school and can leave whenever she wants because she has told the school she has problems with depression and anxiety. Please don't think I'm. hating on her, I'm not.

test_pid_781,"I think I want to end it : Why don’t I just end it all now?
I’m 20 years old. I live in a 1 bedroom house which I share a bedroom w my mom and step dad. I have multiple health problems and years of childhood trauma not even dr phill could fix. i’m 3k in debt and need dental work, surgery and i’m trying to get out of a toxic horrible living environment all w almost no money in my bank acc. I can’t go anywhere, I’m not allowed to drive, not allowed to have a license. Not allowed to leave w out supervision. (Very toxic environment) and so on.  My day is wake up, change my grandmothers diaper do chores, things to pass time. Feed my grandma, take care of her. Pass time again. Night falls, change her diaper place her in bed. I thought about applying to college which of course I have to do in secret because i’m not “smart enough” to be anything according to my family. I sit in an invisible prison cell no one but me sees and I can’t be heard or seen crying for help inside. Everyday I think about life on the other side. How easy things are to end if I just do it. But I think about the very small list of people I care about. Just 2. 2 people who I know would be hurt and that gives me much drive not to. But everyday I hear in my head they’ll move on. They will be ok. I used to self harm constantly for hours at a time. That was my way of coping for any pain I felt inside but I promised myself I would stay clean and I’ve done so since June 5th 2019. It’s been a long time and at first I thought I really quit this time. I won’t do it again but lately I catch myself browsing blades on amazon, wanting the high. the escape all over again. I joined subreddits, discord servers, virtual support groups but overall nothing really helps. Yeah I can sit and listen to people say it gets better all day. They can tell me ways to be happy my head is above water that day and this day but at the end of it all. I am still here. I am still going to wake up and go to sleep living the cycle I’m trapped in. I’m still going to suffer. Not really sure what else I can add here, I guess maybe I just wanted to be heard in a crowd full of strangers.",1
test_pid_782,"Something's wrong and I'm falling behind in life. : **This is a message I'm submitting to my university counselling service. I have never done any kind of counselling before and for some reason I feel better about also posting it here from a throwaway account. I don't know what to expect, but if anyone has any thoughts I'd love to hear them:**
""Hello, I'm finding it very hard to talk about this but I think I need help and I see there aren't any counselling appointments free for a couple weeks so I don't know what else to do.
I'm not sure exactly how this is supposed to work so I apologies if this is a long message, but it might be easier to get it out this way first rather than face-to -face.
To be honest I think I've been struggling for a while but never tried counselling before as I have been able to either power through or scrape by just well enough to convince myself that there wasn't a problem or that I was in control of it. But I've been finding it increasingly harder to cope recently and I don't think I can do this on my own anymore.
I've always had issues with procrastination, putting off important work and then rushing to get it done last minute, but for the most part, as bad as it sounds, this used to work for me and I'd get my work done on time and to a reasonable standard without feeling excessively stressed or anxious.
However, lately it feels like my life has been falling apart around me piece by piece and I can't find the will or energy to do anything other than stress out about it. This extends beyond my university life and has also affected my freelance work, which is my main source of income and something I'm normally very passionate about. I haven't even played video games in the past year or so, which used to be one of my main hobbies. At this stage, I find it extremely hard to even get out of bed on most days, and usually have to scream and swear at myself, sometimes literally, to do so. I now feel like I am genuinely just wasting my life away, often even avoiding my friends and loved ones because I ""have work to do"" only to end up idly watching the days go by and do nothing, which is all the more painful since I am fully aware of how limited they are. This, together with my quickly deteriorating academic and financial situation have all been piling up to the point where I am constantly in a state of anxiety and despair and find it hard to think clearly or even sleep.
Apart from these problems, I know I have a pretty good life, I am honestly ashamed that I can't fix this on my own and believe I have no right to feel the way I do, but I am in my last year of university, with the end in sight, and I know that I can't afford to fail my courses, which is why I'm reaching out for help.""",1

Going back to sleep. I’m trapped in a nightmare and I’m not sure I’ll ever claw my way out. The drugs aren’t helping and I have no friends or family to talk to.

test_pid_784,"I want to get better but idk how. : I cant even sleep, its kind of ridiculous how afraid I am of not even being able to watch an episode on Netflix without browsing for a good hour. I go to sleep so late, at 5am because I cant sleep. I just lay in my bed and put on movies Ive watched all so I can accomplish something. Today I had a pb and j sandwhich and Tuna. I eat when I wake up, a sandwhich if there is bread, then i wait for dinner to be made, my grandma or grandpa will make something but if they dont then I dont eat anything. Its just so much effort to do anything and I dont understand why. I havent showered in so long, I have a feeling I smell but no one says anything but I know I do. I had a friend over and I washed the sheets the day before but i feel like my whole room smells because its the only room im in everyday. I use to play video games but I just lost my interest in playing they are just too much effort so i just watch movies and shows now. But even then I find it hard to watch something I have to debate whether I should watch it or not. I do brush my teeth but i dont shower. I know i just typed it but im really just typing to empty my thoughts its just constant. I was diagnosed with MDD and prescribed meds for it but I was picked up by my mother and taken to a different state and then I was never given anything. I had to go to a psych ward which was where I was diagnosed. Why am I like this. I feel as though my mood got worse and the intensity snowballed throughout my days in school. I was a talkative person but as I got older I became quiet and then I just stopped talking altogether and it got worse and worse. I never saw it coming and now its like I get a day where I just sit on the floor and call anyone I know just to talk because I feel as though I should just kill myself right then and there. But everytime I cant do it. I think the day someone doesnt answer is the day I might end up doing it. Theres so much on my mind. And then on friday im supposed to go to some funeral in california but I dont care for it i dont even know the person thats dead. My grandma said I was going im 18 so i could just stay and i think i should its a funeral and i feel itll just make things worse. Does anyone know why im this way? I feel terrible all the time. Sorry for the long post i meant for it to get straight to the point.",1
test_pid_785,I’ve given up : I don’t know how people survive depression but I can’t do it anymore I just want to give up. I know I made the wrong decision by telling my therapist that I want to stop my therapy sessions but the voices in my head told me to do it. I’ve tried to do everything to stop myself from committing self harm but so far nothing have worked. I want to kill myself but my dog won’t understand and I know my family wouldn’t care because they were the ones that abused me. In a few days I’m turning 15 that’s when I’m planning to go to the bridge near my house and jump into the 110 freeway so that way it will be quick and I won’t be in pain anymore. I know my moms trying her best to make me feel better but it hasn’t worked and I try to make myself feel better by doing my hobbies but my mom don’t support them. So yeah I’ve made up my mind to kill myself and after writing this I’m going to start writing my suicide letter to my mom and telling her how much I love her and how much I love my dog and siblings. So yeah thank you reddit for all the stuff y’all entertain me with and bye guys.,1
test_pid_786,"i’m sabotaging myself : sleeping doesn’t help me, if I stay awake it’s easier for me to handle everything because nothings expected of you at night, there’s no “you have to be doing something” other than sleeping, but the night is where I feel most, whether it be good or bad, (mostly bad) i’m just tired. physically and mentally, trying to say the same thing to people who don’t listen, trying to explain something but not being able to properly articulate it without getting frustrated. I don’t think I can do this anymore, i’m hurting my family without getting help, but I can’t get help if I don’t want it and am not ready for it yet, what do I do

test_pid_787,"Is it today : I'm a little lost for words, but my soul is screaming for me to say something... anything.
I love my aging and ill parents so much. I love them with all my heart and soul. I see their faces in my mind's eye and tears automatically fall, and I'm filled with a sad but deep love that is too great for me to comprehend. I haven't seen them for a long time. I will not be able to handle their passing. I'll go blind and mad and melt into the soil, and transform into a mist until all my constituent parts disaparate completely as if it was never there in the first place, until I'm just a vague and unknowable character from a distant memory of some strangers dream that's already slipped through their fingers as they tried to recall it. 
Do you know those ordinary people who were alive 500 years ago? Of course you don't. And nobody does. All their dreams, aspirations, passions, hopes and all their love is gone. Well maybe some of it has passed on from generation to generation, but then whose do they belong to? I'm sorry, this probably doesn't make sense. But what I'm saying is... how important is it really for us to do all these ridiculous things we're supposed to do in this insane world?
I broke up with my gf a lifetime ago and I still can't get over her. My love was real babe. I miss you. I never lied, and I haven't moved on. I simply can't. Nobody will replace you. My love meant something. My love means something. I messed up by neglecting you, but that's it for me. My love is real and I am not gonna just let you go in my heart. I will never do that. Love is painful beyond comprehension. Why the hell would I want to do that again and also minimise what I felt for you. Never.
I'm so lucky to have a bro who gives me a roof over my head, and food to eat. He's so patient and understanding. But I don't know for how much longer I can take being dependent on others just to exist. I am burnt out and exhausted. Getting through each day is a huge feat, and I don't even do much at all. I can't face this world. I want to die and wake up when this world system is completely changed. But that's a fat chance, so I guess I'll just die and stay dead. I wish I had the energy to help change this world, even on the smallest scale, but my contribution feels futile and pointless because I can't even go to an interview for a job without dissociating and making an idiot of myself. 
I can't think straight now. My brain is all mush. All I can think about is what's happened in the past replaying itself over and over again. All I can think about is ""moving out"" my bros place and going to hang myself in some desolate and lonely place. It's all I think about every single day. 
I'm thinking about doing it right now.",1
test_pid_788,"Feeling much better, I actually have feelings again not just numbness : So for a long time I was in a deep dark depression, maybe a bit over two years. With regular bits of depression in my life before but not completely suicidal like I was in those two years. For a long time I felt really numb emotionally, couldn't feel excitement or happiness. Or times I could feel them were very minimal. I only really felt sadness and anger for many years even before my darkest time. I really tried hard to find something that made me feel anything and found that I liked hiking and white water rafting although it just sparked the tiniest feelings in me then. Over time I could feel a bit more something that was less sadness. Finding a passion got me to a point where I was functional, I had to do something every weekend for a long while. I went alone a lot too but luckily people went with me occasionally. I still was working a good amount which I always did but having something to look forward to helped a lot. 
I started seeing a therapist which did help actually even though I was functional at this point but still feeling pretty numb. Talking about things with her helped me open up and I realized it was me who was numbing my emotions. Trying to close myself off to sadness and anger also closed off joy and excitement too. So I'm allowing myself to be more open and cry in front of people. Learning about feelings and how to convey them which I was never taught before. I've gotten to the point where I can feel good feelings again and now more than I've ever been able to before. Just from normal things like watching movies or seeing beautiful scenery on a hike. After this I ended up meeting a great guy too, we have a great relationship and great sex. Of course I've dated a lot of crappy guys before him but it's still amazing to find someone you work so well with. I'm really thankful that I kept trying.
I just want to say that it's possible to get better and keep trying. You're all amazing for making it so far and keep on working to beat your depression. I wish you all the best and I'm sorry things are so hard but it can get better.",1

I’m just writing this here because I don’t know where else to get my thoughts out, and I’ll probably just delete it later. I don’t know if I have depression and if I’m just feeling something other than depression then I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to cheapen anyone else’s struggle. I have a semesters worth of LA and geometry online classes to do that are due tomorrow, and I don’t have the time or energy to get them done. There’s a very good chance I’m going to repeat my sophomore year. I don’t have anyone to go to, if I try to express how I feel to my mother she somehow victimized herself. I barely see my dad anymore because of the divorce, and my girlfriend is thousands of miles away. I don’t have any friends that I can talk about stuff like this to. Ever since the start of middle school I’ve always consistently gotten failing grades, mostly out of laziness and not caring. Only this semester and last semester I’ve actually gotten any of my shit together. Somehow I’ve limped through my entire school career with all Fs and never repeated a grade, and now I think I’ve destroyed my last chance.  The one time I’ve actually started wanting good things for myself I fuck it up worse than I ever have before, and now I can’t handle the consequences. I have no one to blame but myself, I frequently make bad decisions, and I can’t seem to make myself care enough to make good ones. I can’t talk to my mother as I said before because she’s really mentally fragile, and I can’t have a serious discussion with her about things like this without her having a breakdown. I’ve been thinking about killing myself a lot but I just don’t want to hurt my family and friends. Even if you didn’t know the person hearing about a suicide is always really sad.

The title is the reality, and I want to post this  in a couple of places so either I can find some help, or perhaps help others express what they're going through to get the help they need., so here it is.
THIS is what depression is...this is what depression does....
-It takes your strength, mentally AND physically alotnif the time
-it takes your family, they decide they can't help, get frustrated that you aren't ""magically"" better because they told you ""just be happy""
-it turns your kids away because your ex couldn't deal and now tells them your crazy
-it takes your SO because they ""have their own issues and can't deal with yours"" and make them tell you they no longer are attracted to you and only stay because ""they've no where else to go""
-it takes your motivation, it zaps any ideas of hope, kills the happiness you used to find in doing things
-it takes away your friends, many of whom may have known you for decades because they don't want to hear it
-it takes away your worth because you no longer know what's happening, how to fix it and/or where/who to turn to for help
-it takes away your life, either through directly hitting bottom and killing yourself or (like me) by taking away any support you may have once had and sappimg your finances in useless doctors who just give you more useless and expensive medications artially because you can't explain how your feeling, or the side effects make things worse ore just add new troubles
-it takes your support and loving group because you're no longer interested in going places, doing things, having sex
My"" friends "" don't check in on me because their ""to busy"", but talk to my SO every day, my children ignore me because they don't like me and have been told not to by my ex, my wife told me the other day she isn't attracted to me now because ""YOU NEVER feel good"" when I tell her that and ask for her love and support to hopefully get some help. My stress levels are so elevsted the medication no longer seems to have ANY effect, my finances are in rubble because of medical bills, a divorce and a custody  battle that's never ending, the ONE CONSTANT/supporter in my life is fading out because her life is improving and no longer really has time for me...I have no friends , the ""friends"" i do have only contact me when they need something from me. 
I've been low before, but not this bad, not this long, and I have no where to turn, no money for therapist, qualify for NO financial aid because of my work income and this horrible government we have in the US , and it's all just getting worse 
the ONLY reason I've not eneded my life is because I'm being constantly nreminded (by the ONE PERSON who's SUPPOSED to love and care for me) that my insurance doesn't pay out for sucide, and she wouldn't get any money. (YES, I was told that...not because she doesn't want me to die (she would be ""free then"") but because she wouldn't get any money)
I'm tired of the fake ""I love you""s, I'm tired of spending all day alone to come home to a house full of people and be alone,left out, forgotten, ignored
I'm tired of ALWAYS being the one to ask for help (which many of you know is hard enough to do) only to be told ""Incant help you"", I'm tired of looking for the affection I need only to get sighs of disgust, and hugs you would give a stranger, or a kiss in the check like I was some distant relative instead of your husband, your father, your loving realitive. I'm tired of being thought of last.  I'm tired of even the pets being treated better than me by my own family.
I'm tired, just tired , not slept in days, not stopped crying off and on for over a month, not feeling in pain constantly, asking for help but being told no one will help you till I STOP being in pain, not feeling good, being interested in sex, doing things, getting help.
it's the catch 22 if depression...THIS is what it does...THIS is what it is...THIS is my life, my 52 years, knowing that I'm destined to just continue to suffer in silence, alone, for who knows how much longer 
THIS is something I fear will never end",1

If I value my school work, I'm up until 1 in the morning trying to finish my school and homework with no down time. If I value my mental health I start to fail my classes.

At first i posted about the “incident”. I dont even want to remember that. I have hit my mother. From this point, it feels like ive been living in hell of guilty. The second post is similar one but backstory i should say. 
Before the incident i have had depression but not that serious. I just didnt want to do anything. But i had hope the situation might get better and i will change too. At now it is gone. I dont know how my life did come to this way. When i was young i was happy even though i got bullied. I wish i was born again. Back to the age of baby.
It feels like no one will read this but its okay. I do this to improve my writing skills and to feel look back how the situation is and so goes on. I feel so much better when i do this.
My parents saying that i should go to college. But i have no power to do that. I feel so depressed that all i want to do is just watching youtube. Of course i sometimes do something but definitely not going back to college. When it comes to my college problem, my parents become so much violent and i dont know why. To add more problem, i should work as public agent for two years. I should apply til end of this year so i can work next year. It is mandatory. Fortunately i don’t get drafted cause of my previous hospitalization record. 
Anyway i understand my dad. My dad cant work after some years due to age so he wants me to get a job after graduation. Well i think he is right more than 90%. I wanna know what you guys think. For me i want to live a life abroad challenging various thing or going travel and meet different kind of people(If i should have a dream except death). But college cant help anything about it. There are more ways to earn money not only as safety manager(my major is safety engineering by the way). If i have will to do it, i can do it. But not now(i know it sounds lazy as fuck but i dont want to do anything except dying which is i scared of). So i want to take few semester off and do what i mandated for country while i decide. 
If you see this and read all of crap i wrote, please comment about what i should do now. I know i am too dependent to other people but i need help. Thank you",1

But due to my job, and our unique (bear with me, I'll explain) circumstances, we're living from paycheck to paycheck, with no hope of getting out of our mental health, financial, and housing challenges. Nor being able to afford helping our children have a bright future. This is not even considering fairly severe climate anxiety from my wife and I.
My dear wife suffered much childhood trauma, so much so that she's been diagnosed with C-PTSD. The diagnosing psychologist told us that because it's not in the latest DSM, it's not officially recognized, and thus we cannot secure support for it. And just a few months ago she was diagnosed with Fibroyalgia. Just yesterday, her gynecologist told her there's a growth of tissue next to her c-section scar. It's been causing her immense pain on top of the usual Fibro pain. She's got some therapy, but her sleep and gastrointestinal system cause daily problems. She's strong, and she's organized, but the load for her is physically, mentally, administratively immense.
Our oldest child was diagnosed with a very rare brain disorder at 6 months that manifests as severe cognitive/mental/physical disabilities. They're Deaf, use a wheelchair for mobility, and use diapers. We're cognizant that children with severe special needs don't have typical life spans. As a result we're making plans for both their passing, and care for them should we pass, or are physically unable to give them care. They go to a decent school with excellent student/teacher ratios, and their laugh is food for the soul. But diapers for a 9 y.o., wheelchair van upkeep, leg braces, and medical CBD for their anxiety makes for a tight budget. They're on their second wheelchair, and we just finished paying off their first wheelchair last year. It was not covered by my job's health insurance, and we were left with over $5k to pay out of pocket. If it wasn't for the portion covered by the province, we'd still be paying it off.
Our middle child was diagnosed at 5 with moderate to severe Autism, and developmental delay. There's a decent chance they will also need our care for their entire life. Like our oldest, we must plan for their care should we pass, or are unable to provide their care. Their therapy that worked in the past is absolutely not in budget. There is no publicly available therapy for any children with Autism in our province. School is not on the radar because there is not enough support. They were enrolled for their first year, but literally escaped the school too many times. Many meetings, letters and such were had but no improvements were on the menu. We homeschool when my wife is physically able.
Our youngest child had an accident when they were an infant that led to hospital visits of varying lengths, specialists, and the involvement of both police and children's aid. They were just recently diagnosed with severe Generalized Anxiety to the point where the paediatrician was ready to prescribe prozac immediately. We've decided to go the medical CBD route for their mental illness as well as therapy offered free through my place of work. Because of the anxiety's severity, we homeschool our youngest when my wife is physically able.
My mother was diagnosed, treated, falsely cleared, re-diagnosed, and re-treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. She's been in remission for a few months and her hair is growing back, but my parents live over 2400km away and travel is not in the budget.
After my mother was diagnosed, I cried every day. Sometimes several times a day. I felt like my entire life was imploding and dreamt of just dying. I didn't make any suicide plans, but it was on my mind very often. I knew deep down that it would only benefit me and no one else. I tried to stay exercising, but haven't seen the gym in months now. My doc put me on a fairly heavy dose of Effexor, and now my blood pressure is creeping up. I still feel like my life is imploding, but at least I'm not actively looking for ways to off myself. My wife and I kind of joke with each other about how we're lightning rods for the whole province.
Our home is not ideal, our oldest child is one floor below us, and we're in constant fear of not hearing them through the monitor we have if they need us in the night. The noise is incessant from many types of aircraft and traffic. The wind howls nearly every day because of our proximity to an airfield. Our shed makes ramshackle look ritzy and we're literally waiting for it to fall down. My wife cannot find a job because our province's school system is failing two of our children. As parents, we are on constant and never-ending meltdown prevention for our children. We only kind of joke with each other about wondering what will happen next. We cannot afford upkeep on our wheelchair van. We cannot afford the therapies that would help our children the most. The money we're able to save is towards our children's RDSP's and RESP's. There is also some money saved to buy an accessible home but we cannot afford to find a home that isn't next to an airport, let alone one that is accessible for my oldest child, or my wife's Fibro.
Our mental health is in tatters, we don't have anyone who can provide respite overnight. I've resorted to googling if there's any wealthy people who can be a sponsor for our family that seems plagued by calamity and setback. Beats committing suicide, I suppose. My wife and I are both sleeping terribly, we're both in need of peace and quiet for a few days. We're both trying desperately to have enough mental energy to ensure that our kids don't grow up neglected, or grow up with worse mental health than us. But we can't go on. We're just making it through each day because we can't just die.",1

I have the plan, with multiple steps to make sure it works and I won’t be a survivor with more scars. My friends don’t understand, my ex shattered every ounce of my being, betrayed my trust, my love, my hopes, my dreams, our future. I’m left with nothing starting from scratch. And I don’t have the strength left. Something had always held me back but I can’t anymore. The problem is me. I can’t even make friends who are normal. I’m so fucked uo and I’ve lived through more shit that any 29 almost 30 year old should ever have to endure. I have virtual friends through phone. I’m in a foreign country because of my ex who wants nothing to do with me. Her family that is supposed to love me as they’re own don’t talk. I have no family my self and every keeps giving the same pep talk and I’m tired of it. I’m in total darkness. And it’s all I see. Is what this year should’ve been. 
Im tired of my life, I’m tired of loss and pain. Losing the ones I really let in. I’m so damaged. And no one can handle it. I’ve been depressed for years. Walking depression yet it creeps up and destroys all I hold close. Time after time. I don’t want to go back to the US. I left myself too many financial problems and my ex said it would be okay because I’m here with her. She lied and betrayed. I tried taking my life the night we broke up. But with the look on her face and how she broke down I couldn’t. I then in a fit of rage at myself did the unthinkable and caused the most damage. I stabbed myself deep in the leg. They sent me home. 
I’ve healed but I continue this circle. I’m doped yo on enough meds that if I take them all along with a bottle of liquor and using the box cutter she never should’ve given me back. Laying in a warm but and making the crucial cuts after taking the rest. There will be no making it through. I’ll fall asleep and drown in the tub. I have it planned to the point that 1 of 3 ways will take me out.

My NPS told the cops that I might an alcoholic.
We had a fight started because he didn't get what he wants it without telling me that need to be hug and given affection. It was 2am. He wants to talk about his feeling when before I asked him if there's something I can do for him while he is having panic attack. I was asking him couple time if there's something I can do for him to make him feel better. He said no. So I left him be in the guest room while I takecare myself after long day from work.
After I took care of myself, I asked him again if there's something I can do for him. He said no and just asked to snuggle. So did snuggle and as my usual night, I have couple drink just to wind down and enjoy my night at my house (he is living in our house where he threw my stuff without telling me or saying anything - I asked the cops and they said it is illegal to do so, when they come to my house to pick me up to be taken to the hospital because of my suicidal attempt). 
We had an argument at 2am right when I said that I'm tired and ready to go to bed. But as he wants to talk about his feeling at 2am, he got upset just because I was being more affectionate towards our dogs instead of him. And I said oh my god, he became so upset and said he will ""kill himself, or going away with the dogs without me, or left everything behind just disappeared"". I got panic attack and told him, that if he died, I will be responsible for him trying to die. So I told him just to left my house and take the dogs with him because I know he will feel safe if the dogs with him. I was about to call my sister after he left, but he didn't. We had an argument where he said that I'm a narcissist, I'm an alcoholic, I'm an evil person period. I become more upset and told him to leave me and my house, because my house has became a safe place for me since I left our house.
I hit my head with a bowl because I was so frustrated because he just doesn't want to leave me and I felt if I'm that bad of a person maybe I should just died and be disappeared from this life so I don't hurt anyone else. He told me that I rejected all the love his try to give me because I was afraid. He treated me badly when we are together. He tried to control a lot of things. He cheated on me. He made me feel afraid of speaking up. He controlled a lot of things because of his insecurities of things.
I went to the hospital and the nurses and doctor were so nice to me, even the cops that took me were so nice. I was handcuffs and I was taken to the hospital in the cops car. It was scary moment of my life, because I thought they will take me to the jail and since they thought I drank a lot of alcohol. When I was in the hospital, the results of my alcohol was zero. 
The disappointed part being in that hospital is when the social worker came and talk to me. She made me doubt myself. She told me that my alcohol level was high and she told me why is it becomes about me instead of about my NPS spouse, because he the one that panic attack. First I already check-in with him he needs anything. After I talked to her, it made me questions myself ""am I the crazy one? Am I doing the wrong things? Should I just be disappeared from here and ran away from this hospital?"". I felt terrible. I felt that I should just be gone. And until today I get so confuse who I am anymore. 
After I got out from the hospital, I feel better. My medication helps and I feel I have to be strong and keep going. And I have to get myself back. The person that care about other and the person that loveable. It's hard when you lost yourself in a relationship and they made you doubt yourself if you are a good person. All the guilt that people put me through, I have to start to ignore that because when they got into a condition that make them harm, it's their own decisions to do so - it's not my fault. I need to learn that when people say bad things towards me and try to blame on me on the things that happened to them, I need to be strong and say that is not my decision and it's not my fault. The guilt is hunting me and I need to be better about selecting what is my fault and what is other people decisions.",1

Last semester, I stopped doing work near the end; this semester, I haven't done any work at all. And the worst part? My family doesn't know. My mom wants me to do well, and i feel incapable of saying no, so i went to college, and I lie to her and the rest of my family about doing my homework. I know for a fact she's gonna find out soon. I was lying to myself, too, trying to convince myself that everything's under control, but now, I desperately need help. I used to see a therapist starting at high school, but she just went on maternity leave lately, and I'm having trouble trying to get into touch with another therapist.

It was great at first, then a bit stressful, then a lot stressful, and now to the point I want to cry every day because I just can’t mentally keep up with how much they make me do (which, to be fair is a lot more than they should be. Because of low staff I’m forced to pick up jobs that are nothing to do with my actual job)
My boss has told me that we all have to do stuff we don’t like so suck it up I guess.
But I just find everything so hard now.
What the fuck am I meant to do.
Pills don’t work, fakin it til I make it doesn’t work. What actually works or am I going to be in this constant rut for the rest of my life. I don’t know if it makes any sense but I’m so tired of wanting to die every day. I WANT to be happy and feel normal but I don’t know how else I can do this. My self care is at the minimal it needs to be for workplace professionalism but I just-  ???

test_pid_841,"I'm too ""emotional"", so stay away : And I'm starting to understand that's why people don't like me and leave. But I grew up in a very open community that didn't shy away from telling the truth or being emotional when necessary. Or at least without being judged for it.
I was talking with a girl who told me her roommate said to ""stay away from me"" because I was emotional. The girl didn't mean it to be rude, she just seemed surprised. Her roommate was literally an ex co worker I had friendly relations with at work and never talked with outside of it. I thought we were cool. But she's friends with the same people who ostracized me while abroad, and I'm getting the picture that they thought I was ""too emotional"". But how else was I supposed to be? I was depressed and halfway across the world and entirely alone, none of them can understand because they all had friends/girlfriends who came with. They made me feel worthless and then judged me more when I was sad for it.
I struggle a lot, but I never bother people with my depression. I'm not a toxic person, and I don't expect anyone to fix me. I'm an adult and not entitled to anyone's time or friendship. But am I not even entitled to my own feelings? I thought that was the one thing that was mine, but apparently I was wrong.",1

At the beginning of January, i was forced to come out to my homophobic, muslim parents after my mom saw a few texts on my phone basically outing me. I had an amazing boyfriend before that who helped me build myself up from previous experiences but was forced to break up and cut contact with him. Ive been shut in ever since. Only allowed to work for them (when convenient for them and usually without pay for odd days) and finish my a-levels which im taking for the 2nd time since last year I was in a deep depressive slump, unable to work properly. havent sen most of my close friends since, nor am i allowed to have proper contact with them. not allowed to have a phone either since mine was taken away, and for the brief moment i had it after the fact, it was taken every night to be monitored.
My parents telling me things such as ""we cant have a gay in the house"" to ""Youre the most selfish person i have ever seen"". Mind you i come from a well off family. Ive never done drugs, smoked, drunk or even rebelled against my parents, always done my best in my studies and so on. But suddenly im this monstruous child. Im being made to ""change"" or else i cant live with them. If i want anything i would ever want for myself, id have to leave the house, and for an 18 yo who isnt even being allowed to open a bank account or work, this is seemingly impossible. Also adding to the fact that ive been sent to therapy, me finally thinking i might have a chnace to make my parents see a side i couldnt manage to convince them to, only for my mom to take solo sessions with the therapist and make me seem like some sort of sick person... living has become unbearable. I can't focus on my studies because of this mess and its the only thing that could potentially get me out of it, since they're refusing to send me where i wanted to study, but instead send me to a muslim country so that i would get ""straightened out"" .

I have no family both parents died in my early to mid 20's no cousins, aunts, uncles, siblings. I am utterly alone in this world and if I died my body would go unfound until the neighbors reported an awful smell coming from the apartment.
I live in a very small town with nothing but a few fast food places and restaurants and a walmart. no uber, no taxi, no bus. nearest small city is 2 hours away one way and no way to get there.
I just can't keep living like this. there is no point anymore to keep living. if you call this living it is more like drowning. I can't even enjoy playing video games because I have no gaming system. I don't even have a vehicle and can't get one. I been trying to save but every time I do things come up like needing to get this tooth looked at which will cost $400 dollars from a specialist to find out if it is cancer inside the bone or not and to see if the tooth can be saved since it is the only tooth on my side I can chew on.
I am in debt up to $2,500 dollars from just trying to survive during the month to month with being on disability it doesn't give much to survive on. I just can't do it anymore so maybe it is just for the best.

It’s come to the point where every time I get a Reddit notification, I tense up in anticipation of someone saying something mean to me.

I find it very difficult to open up and talk in therapy (CBT) and i have known this for  a very long time. It has never been effective for me personally. Recently I went to the GP as I was wating to go on antidepressants as I dont think there is any future with therapy. I told the GP about how I have been etc. This GP said I'm not willing to put you on antidepressants and gave a leaflet about online therapy as 'easy to open up'. I was left baffled. I have no idea what to do. I haven't been at school for a couple weeks as it has been particularly bad. She has told me to come back in 2 weeks and use the online therapy. But I know it wont help. Anyone got some tips on getting antidepressants. Maybe change GP? I cant let this go on as I'm a smart person who is hoping to go to uni and me being off school is hindering my performance.,1

test_pid_858,"life advice : to preface this, im not diagnosed with any mental illnesses as every time ive tried to get a diagnosis its dismissed as being something related to external circumstances. 
so basically ive been out of education since 2018, im 16 now. i was planning on doing all the gcses i wanted to but i cant focus on things and i have no motivation so i whittled it down to just english language, english lit and maths. then i decided even that was too much so i dropped everything altogether. i try and look after myself but i really dont, i sleep for like 9-12 hours a day and the rest of my day is spent lying in bed looking at the wall or binge watching tv shows even though im not really paying any attention, i go between eating one small meal a day to eating everything in the house, i cant get out of bed to brush my teeth a lot, i only wash my hair because i have a habit of picking my scalp lol. i have a good circle of friends but i feel like i dont actually like the person im closest to but my whole social group would drop me if i ever decided to distance myself from him. it doesnt help that i only really like the pursuit of friendship, i like being completely obsessed with people and if that becomes reciprocated i lose interest. i isolate myself for weeks at a time and nobody even seems to care.
my moods are also extremely turbulent, ill feel completely invincible for like 20 minutes and then ill be seriously contemplating suicide and its really tiring for me, especially because i feel like i just cant talk to anyone without getting some kind of reaction, people love telling me i just want attention or they start talking about themselves when really i just want them to listen to me. my dad has had a pretty shit life as well, he suffered with a lot of mental illnesses and addiction and all that shit, so he wants to help me and he sees my potential but i dont have the best relationship with him so its hard for me to let him do that.
it doesnt help that i find it impossible to go to any appointments relating to my mental health, i consistently had panic attacks before them so i stopped going, and seeing all my friends going to therapy and seeing that it doesnt help them (camhs LOL) makes me reluctant too.
i have such a desire to do something meaningful with my life but every time i have an interest it lasts like a week and then im over it. its SO hard :( i find it hard to leave the house and i also get extremely anxious and act very weird during social situations so its just not really an option for me to pursue anything.

I always have a plan at the beginning of the semester and it always falls through after a few weeks. : So each semester, I write down goals (that I perceive to be achievable) that I plan to stick to for the whole semester. And after about a month, I start falling through the cracks here and there until I finally just...give up. For example, this semester my goal was to exercise 4-5x a week (1 hour each session), focus more on nourishment during eating rather than caloric intake, practice self-care each day, and not use my phone until I get my homework done each day. I started slipping on the exercise, I started stress eating, I started to procrastinate...until it got to the point that I just wasn't even following my plan anymore. I feel like a part of this is due to the fact that college is haphazard and doesn't always follow a strict schedule, but I also feel like this is some deep-seeded issue inside of me.
So far, this issue has popped up each semester. And I'm starting to think that maybe this is just inherently a flaw that I carry and can't change. I'm tired of having all this determination inside me being bogged down by what seems to be depression, lack of motivation, and stress. Why does this pattern keep happening?

test_pid_868,"I only experience joy or peace when I drink alcohol : I think I might be suffering from depression. I feel like crying several times a day and it takes a lot of effort to suppress it in front of other people. As mentioned, Iately I tend to only experience joy or peace when I drink (mostly beer, wine) or take light drugs (weed, shrooms). I stay away from hard drugs and alcohol.
For a bit of background, I grew up in a dysfunctional family, my mother went missing when I was 15, my father handed me and my brother over to social services a year or so after. I struggled in a children's foster home where my brother and I were only numbers, suffered from the psychological abuse by the people who were supposed to take care of us. Eventually when I hit 18 I left, had to stand in front of the tribunal to get my brother into my custody. I was accepted at the university, also had to work a lot to sustain us. There were people who helped a little, my older half sister financially from time to time, my boyfriend's family practically, my boyfriend emotionally, otherwise I do not think I would be able to manage. I somehow finished my masters and started working.
Just as when I was thinking my life can be a bit normal, my brother attempted suicide and was diagnosed with a severe mental illness. I continued to take care of him and he got better and was able to function, so I decided to do something I have always wanted to do and go and work abroad. I still support my brother financially, but he started living by himself at the age of 21. 
Starting in a new country, huge stress, but I found a decent job, very stressful, decent money, not good enough to be able to ever purchase a house, but enough to get by if you rent. The daily 9-5, 40 hour work week, utilization targets and the nobody-gives-a-damn-about-you culture has really started getting to me though and cherry on the top of the cake is the fact that brother has been recently hospitalized after another return of his illness. He'll probably never be ok.
I just cannot cope anymore. Stress, anxiety about the future, painful childhood memories, remorse over not being with my brother when he needs me and anger that he will probably always be dependent on me, anger that the lack of family support network places all the load on my shoulders, that it is always me that has to be strong, always me who has to cope, always me who has to make compromises when it comes to my life, whether it is about the area of study ( I had to stay in my home town to take care of my brother, instead of pursuing a more interesting degree elsewhere), being able to stay abroad and other. I have never been and never will be free.
I did not choose the majority of events that shaped my life. I chose to go abroad and cannot even enjoy that because I feel remorse that I am not fully there for my brother. If I had the choice, I would have chosen not to be born. I think about death often, but I also think about the pain it would cause to the few people who care. So I am locked in this vicious circle and day-by-day I am getting more tired, more sad, more apathetic. I lack energy to change things. Energy to pursue things that used to fulfill me. Energy to search for a new job. I tried therapy last year, when I was very stressed, shortly after my first ever panic attack and it was not really helpful, so I am not planning to do it again.
I get that some other people have it worse. My brother probably has it worse. People who were physically abused and violated have it worse. That is causing self loathing. I should not be feeling this way. But I do.
Is there anything that can be done to change the way I feel? I do not want to muddle my brain with meds. And my childhood trauma is going to stay unless someone invents a time machine and prevent my parents from breeding.

test_pid_870,"The definition of doing 'nothing' : A few days ago I met up with two friends I haven't seen in a while. Of course the uncomfortable question about what I'm lately doing came up. 
Well I do a lot of nothing lately, like literally nothing. I lay in bed with closed eyes sometimes with open eyes. My head is either an endless void filled with nothing or some horrible chaos filled with negativ thoughts. Or I scroll thru Reddit without really paying attention because I actually just try to avoid thinking shitty thoughts.
So I said I do a lot of nothing lately. 
These two friends don't know about my depression and one said back that he is also doing a lot of nothing. But what he meant was gaming, watching series and so on. I felt to embarrassed to clarify what I truly meant. Explaining to someone else what I really do all day is just to sad.
Another thing I noticed is that if I have a day of doing nothing by my friends definition I see these days as kinda productive because I did something instead of nothing. Kinda weird how my definition of doing nothing kinda shifted more and more into the literally meaning of the word. It makes me feel like a very small person when I think about the things I perceive as small successes at this point. Like when I get myself to play a video game, watching a TV show even if it's just for an hour or simple things like taking a shower. Other people see these things as doing nothing all day...",1

It took me 5 years to start thinking about it this way and only once I did was I able to finally truly help myself... But I keep relapsing back to this. When I pick myself up, I count the days where I stay away from destroying my life - the days where I avoid sleeping all day and missing exams and pushing people away - so far my record is 4 months with only minor blips.

I talked to my guidance counselor at my tech school and after expressing thoughts of suicide she required me to go to my local hospital and make me feel like a fucking basket case. How the fuck did I even get here. Once I was in a hospital room they wanted me to get naked in a gown and socks and they wouldn't allow me to leave which was making me freak the fuck out. I just wanted some calm family counceling or something. That night after telling my best friend what happened he invited me to help him with stage crew which we were fucking around during and having a fun old time just messing around like good old times.

test_pid_874,"Feeling stuck, at a standstill : I'm feeling stuck today.  Unable to move forward, so I thought maybe I should get a bunch of garbage off my mind to see if that helps.  It frequently does.
I guess my experience of what I think is depression, or something like it, is maybe a little different and tamer than what a lot of people here might be going through.  I have trouble getting motivated, focusing.  It's sometimes, but not always or even usually marked by sadness.  That, or I've just gotten so used to being sad that I can't tell the difference anymore.  That idea ... feels like it has merit and scares me a little.
I know I've dealt with this ... whatever it is and whatever label really applies, off and on throughout my life.  I know both my parents struggled with it, particularly my Dad who probably still does.  
I graduated into the last recession.  Had a hard time finding a job.  I did what I could.  Before, physical fitness had been really important to me, but that fell off.  I was in a relationship throughout that time, school and after.  Even as I struggled to find a job I got a lot of pressure from family, friends, and the woman I was seeing to get married.  Looking back I don't know why nobody had my back on that.  Why they didn't pull me aside and say they could see what was going on with me and that maybe this isn't the best decision to make under the circumstances.
I went ahead with it, found a good job, performed well, and started to feel better though.  There had always been issues with my relationship though, and everything I heard and experienced and felt about myself put me in a place of ""you'd better take what you can get.""  So I didn't do a good job of setting boundaries or standing up for myself, and my idea of ""working on"" my relationship was essentially complaining about the same problem(s) over and over again rather than recognizing that there's a time when you should really just end it after you've made your needs and expectations clear.  
I was in a pretty dark place after graduation though, and there was a lot of pressure, so I went through with it knowing there were problems because I essentially believed I wasn't worth more than how I was being treated.  What I wanted and needed didn't matter.  
Through professional success, easing of financial tension I gradually improved.  I found hobbies and started taking care of myself a little better again.  Made new friends.  My marriage wasn't happy though.  I kept talking and trying, but it just wasn't quite right.  I was unhappy and vulnerable, and someone found me and gradually a friendship turned into an emotional affair.  I found myself happy in a way I hadn't felt in a long time.  I found hope for a better future.  I felt things I didn't think I could feel.  It went on for a little less than a year.  I struggle with how I felt, if it was all brain chemistry, if I found someone who was genuinely able to meet my mental and emotional needs.  If I was happy because I was actually happy, actually getting what I needed.  
That ended and was rough, but I moved on and now I'm really aware of all the years that have passed.  That I've wasted on a relationship that didn't work, and I find myself really preoccupied with being jealous, even resentful of happy couples.  People who come home to someone happy to see them, someone affectionate.  I don't have that.  I never have.  I was always kind of a loner, but now I find myself struggling with feelings of loneliness.
I've found things that help.  In particular working out.  That gives me a strong sense of wellbeing.  It lifts me a bit, makes me feel more alive, positive, and enthusiastic.  I try to make it a priority.  
But there are days like today when I should be getting work done, and I just can't.  I can't focus.  My mind feels like it's in a fog.  I feel alone, and I look around and I feel both trapped, but at the same time I see that maybe this isn't what my life should be and that I just need to make th choice to change it.  But that change means losing a lot.  In particular, my kid.  At least half that time.  That's a thought I can barely process.  
That's all, I just wanted to think out loud.  I just feel stuck, and isolated, and I'm having trouble pulling it together and getting through the day.  Nothing feels quite right, just feels kind of hollow and unfulfilling.",1

test_pid_876,"not able to get life back on track, can't stay sober : hello, well its difficult and unnecessary to explain my whole history to you guys so ill just keep it to a minimum. I've had three pretty messed up years. self harmed a lot, started feeling depressed, turned out to be suicidal, tried 3 times, extremely reckless, drug abuse. I'm happy to say I havent really felt that way in a long time. its a thing I wanted so long, to just feel alright. well. unfortunately it isn't as good as I thought it would be. I was clean for like a month. then I started again. now im trying to stay sober again. last time I used/abused Molly and weed was the beginning of this week. well it turns out that those two substances make me feel a little bit better. but my tolerance is so high that its way too expensive to use it, and too dangerous imo. Like I said, im trying to stay sober and get my life back on track. again. ive tried so often but I simply can't give up, even though I have disappointed myself and my previous friends too often. I'm 18 years old and still studying. im not going to lie, its exhausting for me to keep up with everything. its almost impossible for me. And one of my biggest problems at the moment is that I can't be sober. Cant be sober? yes. I guess im addicted to not being sober? ive always used something to be able to get through tough times. it feels like im always a little bit beneath the level of feeling okay. im always seeking for that little piece of happiness that I can't find. I don't really ask for much. I don't need to be the most happiest person alive. but it sucks when you need a substance to feel less horrible. So currently I just don't have a clue how to get my life back together. its been such a huge mess, seems impossible to get out of it. Facts are that I'm going to have to graduate, and keep my mess a secret. I'm just not sure where to start. and my mind keeps and confusing me. one day im fine, the other day I'm thinking about using other substances to numb the pain. im actually thinking about switching to Xanax. don't know if it works but it should at least do something good. and since last week I'm starting to feel like I'm going back to those three years. it feels like I'm becoming depressed again, which sucks. Its probably really confusing what ive written down. To be honest I don't even understand it myself. Is there anyone who might have some tips for me, or some kind of idea what I'm supposed to do? if I do what my thoughts tell me to I'm sure I'm not going to last long, so any support is much appreciated:) and feel free to ask me anything if I left something out.",1

It helped me a bit and they put me on meds (I still am) to try and limit the intensity of my downs. The thing is that I feel numb and barely human compared to everyone else because I am just constantly neutral to everything that happens and I guess that, having my feelings numbed kind of helped me hide them better from people I care about.
I like helping people though, they are pretty much the only reason I am still here, because I do not want to hurt them. Only, these past few weeks, I am feeling myself slipping and relapsing into depression again. It is like I am just not made for it. Like I just do not belong here. I consider ending sometimes, I just do not want to make people around me go through grief or feel guilty about my passing. I thus, put myself in danger sometimes, hoping to die in an accident or something so I do not seem like a selfish prick.

Cut that out for a month at the beginning of the year, relapsed, and am now 39 days sober. Started taking 10mg lexapro December 2018. Resigned / lost my job about 2 months ago. With minimal tethers to the outside world I’ve been withdrawing and avoiding more and more. I don’t answer text messages until days later, sometimes never. I can’t even manage to take my car to get a desperately-needed oil change. I sleep ALL the time. Even after a full 10 hours I’ll sometimes take a nap during the day. I have absolutely no routines. I barely eat, or if I do I crave sweets (maybe bc of cutting out alcohol). I’m not sad, per se. I’m apathetic. I feel nothing (except occasionally guilty and bad about myself, that I’m not strong enough to pull myself out of the malaise). When I do feel something, it’s negative and I usually take it out on my bf by starting dumb fights bc he’s the only one around. Nothing seems interesting, nothing seems worthwhile. My savings won’t last forever, so I need to make some moves to get a new job (but it seems sooo daunting). It’s like I can’t bring myself to do anything. I’ve been suicidal before but don’t even have drive for that. I feel passive. I just hope I randomly have a brain aneurysm and die alone in my apartment, leaving my cat to survive by eating my eyeballs and squishy bits. At least then I’d be useful for something.

I'll be 20 in days, I'm a male. I had really tough time in October, but then came a girl that she was my friend already, we known about each other from primary school but we get to know each other due to the university. I'm in my 2nd year, she's in her first.
So she has a boyfriend, for more than 1,5 year, we were friends, but when I was down back then She made me happy always and we came closer and closer to each other and it happened. She cheated and said that she loves us both, we were very fine, we had sex only twice but slept together very often and she always huged me and I felt that I'm loved.
In December she said she needs time to decide what she wants, always asked her so what do we have between us and if she will break up with her bf. I felt really sad for the guy since I get to know him as well.
So in January she started to keep distance from me and I asked her to always be honest to me, she told everything even if she went to her bf to sleep together and you know...
Time passed and we are best friends, at least for me she is since my long time friends forgot me and don't talk to me any more and she even told me that for her I'm her best friend. She know that I wanted more and I told her enough that I don't just like her as a friend and she used to tell me that too. Now I'm feeling hopeless not just because that but because I feel like I'm not loved, I've lost so many friends (they are not died just ignoring me)
Before we really got closer to each other I' be had plans how to kill myself and I wrote that down. 2 option.
First since I have sleeping problems I have many sleeping pills allowed by doctor, and would try to overdose it with alcohol and jump down from a building, I even checked the place where can I do that
The second option is chloroform and rope.
I feel like I have 2 personality, one is happy with her being my very best friend and wants her to be happy with her bf and the other is wants her to be with me and be happy together.
Ive considered to option, to break the contact with her so I can move on in terms of love and the other is try to adapt but then my other self is being hurt.
So I'm once again wrote down those suicide option and thinking about committing it very strongly.
I see hope that we can be together sometime since we talk and meet each other everyday, but I'm the other hand I know it won't happen. She's not hugging me the way anymore, not cuddling while we watch movies and I really feel like noone loves me.
I was very religious person, went to church sadly just sometimes but prayed and stuff often, now even if I think about God I don't do that, doesn't feel that it can help me.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if choosing to end your own life leads to having to do it all over again because there's some unwritten rule we're not aware of that says 'you don't get to choose when'. When I think back over the last 50 years of my life and how much of that time was filled with angst and depression. How lonely I was as a child, the violence, the abuse, the everyday battle to keep going.. and for what? I had a religious upbringing but those teachings sound so far away from reality. What I can't get my head around is how a merciful God would end the life of those in the wrong religions, wtf! and does anyone know which one is the right one? This shit must be a simulation! I've been on the slide for a while and I wish it was all over. I think about my worklife before the suicide and the 8 months stay in hospital but I just feel so scarred by it all, I know I wouldn't cope going back, I can barely look after myself ffs, I'm just not ready yet but change might be coming whether I like it or not.",1

test_pid_910,"The so called ""help"" for depression lies behind an amount of effort : Long title because i didn't really know how to put that and more of a rant because i need to.
Considering that a large part of what depression is has completely shut me down to the point where I'm completely failing to study in a field i actually am super interested in and enjoy working on (Computer Games Development if you want to know). Now a week or two ago i got a Email from University saying I'm being withdrawn from the course, and to my high surprise i actually got myself upright and got in contact with the student association. i know have the form to appeal it.. the multipage document with 4 pixel writing on every page requiring huge amounts of detailed writing with cited evidence that i also need to actually gather. i have like 2 weeks before it gets auto-rejected.
With all that in mind, this appeal form is directed in part at people with mental health issues and how can i possibly be expected to deal with that in such a tiny time frame. I wouldn't go with continuing my course if i didn't feel i was getting better overall, and thusly am sure i can pass fairly easily next year. Now though with this bloody thing in my way I'm caving right back in, losing months of progress and don't know what to do with my life, to the point of coming up shorter than ever on reasons to continue it. Spent a fair hour or so contemplating posting to r/SuicideWatch or here, but decided since i had at least a few days left in me I'd leave that sub for later. I don't really know either what I'm aiming to achieve with this post since i can't really think of anything I'd respond to this sort of post if i saw other people post it.

 I physically cannot be happy anymore, I try to find fun in anything and I end up destroying it. Oh and I’ve tried therapy all too many times, never works for me.

test_pid_912,"What are you actually supposed to do if you’re suicidal? : TW: mentions of suicide from this point on
For years now, I’ve dealt with my own battle of depression and self loathing but I was able to always get myself out of whatever rut I’d fall into. Growing up a lot of people around me dealt with suicidal thoughts and I’ve had the suicide talk multiple times. It never bothered me personally because I never reached that point where I felt the same way so if course I was willing to help. 
I used to say my anxiety was the thing keeping me alive cause of my irrational fear of what comes after death but now I don’t feel as protected. Actual suicidal thoughts exist in my brain and now there’s positives I “consider” when thinking about it. I’ve become so mean to myself I catch myself thinking how much of a waste I am and how much better everyone and everything would be if I was just dead. I’m always brought back to reality and I count out all the reasons I NEED to stay alive for but it’s just hard accepting that you yourself are suicidal, especially when you’ve spent years trying to help other people. 
What are you actually supposed to do if you’re suicidal? You try telling someone you run the risk of going to a hospital, spending a shit ton of money talking to professional and get some medication? Try telling you’re family and they’ll look at you differently and walk on egg shells around you until yomu’re better. What if there’s never a better time that comes? And every time you’re surrounded by the people you love being happy and every time something goes wrong and you think you should just kill yourself cause you’re a goddamn burden to the world itself, how can you look your family in the eye when that’s the only thing you can think about during a family gathering? Everyone’s always happy and you’re the one sitting away from everyone else cause you can’t ever be that happy.  
Seems like the only cure is medication right? Or just half your life suffering until it just stops?",1

Four times, I’ve gotten close with a girl, and I think we’re really hitting it off, and suddenly they stop texting me. Like a pattern, we text a lot, we start hanging out, going on dates, and then they just stop responding to me. I try everything I can do to fix it but I can’t. It’s a never ending cycle.
I’ve been rejected from my dream school, even after one of the professor’s there came to my mom to talk about how good my audition for their program was, and how much he’d like me at the school. This of course, comes after four other rejections, for good measure. I recently learned that one of my friends has been talking behind my back, which I was kind of aware of, but I didn’t want to believe until now. We got into a little argument recently (not because of him talking about me, but i was already mad at him for that, and that made me lash out at him more), and even though we’re “good” now, i can’t even look at him in the face anymore without getting a little pissed off. 
My life feels like it’s falling apart. I’m so jealous of all my friends, they all have significant others who they care about and who care about them, almost all of them are set for their futures, it makes me feel like a piece of rotting fruit.

test_pid_936,"I’m unhappy with my weight and it is ruining my life. What is wrong with me? : I can’t do anything without worrying about how big I look. I feel like when people look at me, they think one word: squishy. It has been bothering me for years now, since I first lost weight when I was 13. What happened was I found out my mom had cheated on my dad and they divorced. I was an only child until I was 11, so I was devastated. My mom was abusive towards both my dad and me. I vividly remember the first time meeting my moms now-husband (home wrecker) and his 3 kids at a nice pizza place. I didn’t eat anything, and it kinda became a habit. Not sure why I kept on or why I started it. I remember my mom yelling and accusing me of having an eating disorder and I was just appalled she would think that. I really didn’t know how much weight I was losing, until I weighed 100 pounds at 5’6. I remember feeling beyond happy, there really has never been another feeling like it. I remember my mom bringing me food to my bedroom so I would eat. I absolutely refused to eat in front of people. I ate a lot of salad. When I started gaining weight back, I hated myself. My self esteem will not go back to what it was. My weight pattern is stupid.  135-100-135-110-148. I have been forever bouncing between wanting to be healthy and strong, and being thin. It’s like a constant battle in my head everyday and I never have any idea which one I’ll go with when I wake up. I still really struggle with eating in public, but my fiancé has played a huge role in making me feel comfortable enough. Without him there I’m a wreck and can’t do it. All I can do is think about how I’m going to lose the weight, what kind of diet I’m going to try, how many calories should I be eating, etc. and it’s miserable. I feel like such a loser and like I’m a liar. The worst part is how hard it is to lose weight. I can do the exact same things as I used to, and it won’t come off. I’m a failure, a fraud. I impulsively bought an echelon two weeks ago and all I can think about is how lazy I am for skipping 2/14 days. I burst a blood vessel in my eye from throwing up because I overate, and proceeded to hop on the echelon for 60 miles. I usually only do 20, so now I can’t help but feel pathetic for not doing 60 everyday. I have been so irritable everyday and it’s gotten to the point where my fiancé coughing makes me snap. I am 20 years old, and now weigh 124, which is down 24 pounds. Once I get back to 110-115 I will feel so much better, but it’s such an awful ride so far. It has been a long 7 years. I’ve been depressed ever since that first time I lost weight, and I’m not sure which came first. I look through all my notebooks, emails and pictures, and the majority of it is about diets, measurements, weight loss accounts, and progress pictures. I have no hobbies anymore and I just feel so sad/angry/numb. I blame the sadness and wanting to lose weight for why I smoke and have no intentions of quitting. What is wrong with me? How can I stop? Also I’m sorry that this got too long. I don’t know if this makes any sense to anyone because it sure doesn’t to me. Thanks if you read this!",1

I felt extremely inadequate , difficult getting out of bed, no energy to stay up for more than a couple of hours and very meticulous with my meals. But after seeing my mom and dad cry and my siblings concerns, I “changed” and slowly I thought I was getting better.
Fast forward to now, I’m fasting when I can, some days I up my intakes on laxatives because I hate knowing something is in my stomach, have negative harmful thoughts,want to sleep for days and not feel the need to get up and bathe, and drive off to who knows where for long periods of time and lie stating that “I’m hanging with friends”. I want to give up but I also feel obligated to up keep this persona of being a good daughter/friend/girlfriend,etc... and a big provider at home so I haven’t told anyone about it.
Sometime I’ll let my BF know that I’m feeling down and I don’t feel like talking as much (long-distance), but in reality I don’t want to scare him away, especially when it comes to seeking validation from him or really anyone in my life. Even at work I’d rather work till I’m extremely exhausted than rather ask a day off or take a break for lunch.

I am a 16 year old high school student boy living in America, east coast to be specific but that doesn't matter, I lately think that I have depression or i think i am just depressed but i dont really know because my whole life I've been the type of kid to not be the popular kid but I am also not the nerd/geek type of kid. I am i guess a stoner student you could call me because I am an avid weed smoker and I've done a good amount of different drugs considering im 16( i know its young but that kinda my whole point) I only really smoke weed on a constant basis tho. I'm also smart in a couple ways like how I go on Reddit and other computer things like going on the deep web and knowing bitcoin currency and ordering drugs from there and building computers. So, I dont know if I am depressed because I have many of friends in and out of school and I am social and I don't seem very sad at school and when not at home but once I get home and I'm by myself my brain kinda of switches in a way of thinking i guess you could say because i get sad for no reason at home and I just think of killing myself because I start to think of how my mother isn't proud of me because my grades and complete shit and she hates the fact I do drugs and my father isn't in the picture and hasn't been in the picture since i was about 11. Like today probably 15 minutes ago in the shower out of nowhere I just thought about what it would be like to kill myself and make a suicide note. I focused this thought mainly on the suicide note tho and just what I would say in the note to be exact and that thought is what made me actually come on here and make this post.

test_pid_947,"Im so lonely : Hey guys just gonna vent a bit
I'm sitting here in my dorm after another failed attempt to meet people at a club. Almost 2 years I've been here and not one friend.
I would give anything in the world for a girlfriend but I've never had one and I'm 20. I have no experience at all.
The cold darkness outside is haunting me. The artificial top light is so depressing.
I'm seriously questioning if a girl will ever like me. Hell, if I'll ever even have friends again.
If I'm going to be alone forever then it's not worth me staying here. It would be just so easy to sleep forever.
It's just all so sad. I process everything as sad. Seeing other people makes me sad. Thinking about what I want in life is sad. Sad sad sad sad sad.
I really have been trying my best but how can I go on like this, all alone? 
I feel like my life is becoming past mending. I just want everything to be okay.",1

test_pid_949,"I have depression and anxiety and the smallest situations make me suicidal : Here’s examples: in college if I couldn’t figure out work or do well in a class Sometimes I would start to have thoughts of just wanting to die and not be around which is a more mild version of my suicidal thoughts 
Another example is like today I was at work and was pretty tired and down and then I left work and hung w my sibling and tried to snap out of my mood and then we got into an argument that made me feel like they were attacking me basically and then things just escalated and I went on a walk to cry and was just wishing there was a bridge I could jump off.i walked to the lake near my house and looked in the water thinking what could I do.. but tried not to think about it but still did.... I called someone to talk so I wouldn’t do anything like that 
Then i have another question: I went back home and called a suicide hotline and it didn’t help. So then I texted someone to talk and was venting and also just talking and after maybe 2/3 hours I’m calmer and don’t have the immediate wish to die. Is this a thing that happens with depression? Or am I crazy? I don’t know? I’m so confused
Also I’m not going to hurt myself it’s fine",1
test_pid_950,"Weird question: could increased non sexual love interest be a sign of receding depression? : I've been noticing alot of other signs that I might be coming out of my depression but I'm not sure because I feel like it's possible that I've just become numb to the symptoms.

test_pid_957,"Feeling completely replaced &amp; is causing so much pain? : Preface: my depression is already at the WORST it’s *ever* been this past month. This then happens and it crippled me. 
We were so close, for 3 years. He was the ONLY person I trusted and was close to. Last week we argued bc I got out of hospital and he (32M) didn’t visit me, instead talking to local girl (23F). I confronted him and he deleted her and said he wouldn’t even like her anyway because he doesn’t respect her job (online sex work).
He cut me off a few days later, ZERO EMOTION.. I went to drop my stuff off at him and he looked at me like I was a stranger, he walked off part way through the discussion about it and never spoke to me again. To me it’s unfinished conversation, to him it’s forgotten. 
Yes, he readded her, she blocked me, he blocked me, and he added the link to the same adult site she uses in his bio. (??) 
I’m devastated. It’s been 5 days and I sleep about 2-3 hours per night, cry excessively, and can barely eat a thing. I physically cannot face another week feeling THIS horrendous. My thoughts have got dark. On waiting list for NHS therapy, doctors know how low I am but can’t do much more than they are. 
I feel replaced and thrown away for new girl. Painful to know he probably is super taken with, as she very sexual like him, and thanks to my serious health issues I’ve been too sick to be sexual in a while :( he’s got his DREAM fantasy, and i’ve got my nightmare. 
Feel not good enough and like the loser here. I’m here inconsolable while they’re probably having a great time together, me not crossing his mind. I won’t even get closure let alone a apology. 
Just tell me how the hell to get over this. I can’t physically be sad about it for another second. I’m sick of crying. I’m in a lot of pain.",1
test_pid_958,"Random bursts of happiness? : I return home from work, change into comfy clothes, and go on to make some dinner. I decide, I'm craving a hot drink, so I drag myself downstairs, make the cup, and return to my bedroom. Before I even take my first sip, the warm mug in my hands, the aromatic coffee scent in the air, I just feel so happy. Like a surge of emotion that wants to make me convulse into excitement, jumps, and impossible flips in the air. All of which are in my head, cause I can't defy physics, come on now. 
It's like sometimes the simplest things even if I do them all the time will just random hit me like a truck full of happiness and excitement. It doesn't last long, sure. Still. Just so effing weird, you know? Anyone relate or have insight to this?",1
test_pid_959,"Finally told my parents about my mental health : And it went as bad as I expected.
My father was clueless as ever. He even told me that the cure for depression is to go out more. Yes ladies and gentlemen, it's that simple. All these doctors and their advices. All the medication manufactured to combat this disease. Yeah guess what? You don't need them. You just need to go out more. And if you have social anxiety (like me) well tough luck pal...
My mother was in denial and didn't believe that I have depression because if I did (according to her) I would just sit in a room all day doing nothing. Apparently, she hasn't heard about high functioning depression. She has her own problems so I don't want to hold it against her, but she has contributed to my current mental state back when I first told her that I might have depression and she just laughed at me because apparently a 14-15 year old shouldn't know or comprehend the concept of depression at that age...

test_pid_960,"I've got no aspiration, no interest in anything, no fun : Why do I feel like it takes so much effort to do anything in life.
A little background about me: I'm a college student. I've been living a decent life with not much trouble in life. Recently I figured out that I might be depressed. 
I have so much trouble making friends ever since a few years ago. When I meet someone for the first time I try to look cheerful but it gets very tiring and I realized that I avoid gatherings because I find it pointless and tiring. At this point I'm too scared to ask how to make friends nowadays. I hate social media because it makes me sad to see all other people having a blast of life in their lives.
I've got no interest in life or have a hobby that I'm geniunely interested in. I find this espiecially true with my College work. I deal well with doing things that I'm told to but I feel like its a pain to do anything extra outside the coursework because I'm just not interested so I don't feel like putting in effort in doing anything in life. I just want a decent job which pays me but who's going to hire a person like me right who has no interest or passion in whatever right?
Another problem I'm facing is trying to focus on something. I just ""burnout' on anything I do in life. I try to start something new but before I know it I either lose interet and give up. I dont know whether its a focus problem arising from lack of discipline by me or I'm just depressed any my brain is not working. 
I don't know whether I'm suffering from this lack in ""motivation"" because I'm depressed or its just an attitude problem but I really need a way out because I'm starting to lose hope in whatever I do and my future doesn't exactly seem bright with the way I'm going. 
I know there are more serious cases or people with more pressing issues but it would be nice if someone can give me an genuine advice on solving the issues I'm facing.
Thank you.",1
test_pid_961,The lucky dice : I learned something today and I though I would share it somewhere. Life is a matter of luck. Lucky that you’re not born in a third world country. Lucky that you’re surrounded with good people who truly love you and want the best for you. Lucky that you’re a bit good looking and attract some people instead of scaring them away. Lucky that you’re not alone with your thoughts. I want to roll the dice again and end up somewhere else.,1
test_pid_962,"Losing effectiveness : A while back, I ran a lot, 10+ miles a day. At one point it lost its effectiveness and I would cry the entire time I ran.
I started going on 2 hour walks, and they were nice for a while and had a general positive effect on the rest of my day, but now the good mood it imparts doesn't linger.

I don't want to feel like a hallow, emotional, stoic, shell. I don't want to feel detached and like I'm not really in my body. I'm worried this current state might extend for a long stretch of time.

I found out all the things I have today when I was in 3rd grade. I asked my mom why I'm so different from all the other kids at my school. She thought that it was time to tell me everything. Once she told me that I felt like I was an outcast. Even today I have depressive episodes during class and start breaking down because of all the horrible things I'm going through. I've been rejected by every girl I've asked out. They all told me I'm too weird. Valentine's Day was not a great day for me as well. During Valentine's Day at school, I saw everyone giving flowers, chocolate, and gifts to one another. My friends were with their girlfriends while I was sitting in a corner by myself. My friends checked on me a lot during the day to see if I was okay. I told them I was when I really wasn't. I appreciate my friends for everything they do. Every time they checked in with me I saw their girlfriends had an annoyed face. When Valentine's day was over I went home and went to sleep. I have always been judged on the way I talk, walk, eat, dress, and being sensitive ever since I started school. This lowered my confidence and self-esteem. Being autistic I'm not that good at my social skills. I have high functioning autism so I can read write and talk clearly.

I was able to deal with it for most of my life as a teenager but now that I am in my 20's it's becoming harder to hold up the ""mask"".

Recently I've begun to think that I was gay, but I'm not sure if I'm actually gay or if I'm just so horribly lonely that I'll take any kind of relationship from anyone at this point. I just wish that I could disappear and not have to deal with this shit anymore. But I don't think I could kill myself, what if hell is real, what if I'm damning myself to an eternity of torture. Not to mention I couldn't do something like that to my family. I know that they care for me but even that being said not even they know who I really am. The mask stays on for them as well. I find myself having violent thoughts. For example, while standing in an elevator with a guy around my age yesterday, I spontaneously thought about decking him in the jaw. These creeping thoughts come up more and more.
What I just said was actually not true, that was be subconsciously making something up to make myself seem less fucking nuts. I really thought about beating him with the mop handle I was holding (I work as a custodian part time)

My entire life I’ve always felt like there is this space between me and the people whom I associate with, within this space lies a wall that I can’t seem to ever get through. My friends, my family, they all have people in their lives that they spend a lot time with, whether it’s a partner or a best friend, and I just never got to have that kind of close bond with anyone. Last time I had anything close to that was in highschool, and even that person disappeared from my life as soon as we graduated. Now even my first boyfriend makes me feel like he doesn’t want to be around me that much by seeing me maybe once a month, and I know it’s still early into our relationship but I fear that it’ll never get any better if it’s starting like this. And I know people need their alone time and space, I know life can be chaotic and unexpected, but this just reminds me of all the relationships Ive had with the people in my life. 
Every job I’ve ever worked I’ve always gotten along great with my peers, but it always felt like everybody had their clique and I was an outsider. 
Every friend group I’ve ever found myself in made me feel like an outsider. Now don’t get me wrong, I have amazing people in my life who I sincerely appreciate, I just don’t have a close bond with any of them. And having zero close bonds in my life just really makes me feel alone. (And I am pretty much alone 80% of the time so that doesn’t help) I know I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety throughout life, so I try to keep in mind that my mental health does impact my perspective which can help sometimes, but it’s a little more overwhelming lately than usual.

I told him I was depressed(he's the first person I ever told) that I dealt with family abuse and abandonment. At first he pitied me, felt bad for me. But then every time I tried to contact him for some advice or help he'd ignore me. I don't know what happened but after that day everything changed.

  (This section doesn't need to be read to understand the situation I just thought it may be helpful)  
Honestly, I'm not too sure how best to start this post off, I guess I should try my best to explain why I'm making it. I have been dealing with depression since I was 15 or so and have been dealing with anxiety pretty much all of my life. My anxiety started young as separation anxiety simple things like being afraid of being away from my mother, I remember going to therapy at a young age and for the most part, this anxiety kinda dissolved over time. I'd say around the time I started middle school I started to notice generalized anxiety, at the time I didn't think it was a big deal and I didn't feel the need to tell anyone. When high school came around that anxiety got a lot worse and I had started to feel like there was no point in doing things. I would consider this to be the closest thing to a starting point for my depression as I lost interest in things and slowly stopped caring about my grades or my future. It was bad enough that grades were slowly dropping but I started to feel more and more depressed and hopeless. Fast forward to the beginning of my second year in high school and I was pretty much feeling the same way only a lot worse, I frequently had thoughts of suicide and there were multiple points where I thought of how I would go through with it. A friend that I had met online at the time convinced me into going to see my school counselor, it was very difficult and I was scared of people finding out what I was going through. My counselor eventually talked me into getting my mom involved and I started seeing a therapist, within a fairly short amount of time I was diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder (Clinical depression). I was put on Prozac a short time after and would remain on it for a little over a year, my dose was increased multiple times until I was at the maximum safe dosage that I could be on. I never felt any significant change while taking the medication and eventually I stopped seeing my therapist.  
***My current situation***   
The reason for me making this post is because I almost feel like I'm out of options. I'm currently 19 so I have been trying to find some relief for my depression and anxiety for 3-4 years now. I have tried multiple medications (Prozac, Zoloft, Pristiq, and more recently Paxil). None of the medications that I just mentioned have done anything at all for me and my doctor recently put me on Bupropion (150mg XL) which I have been taking for about 5 days now. These past 4 or 5 days have been really rough and I have felt my mood get a lot worse, I was told that this medication would give me energy which I have been lacking for the longest time but the opposite is taking place. Almost every day since I have been taking the medication I have felt exhausted sometimes as early as 2 or 3 pm, I have felt more emotionally sensitive than usual and have been really irritable, my mind has felt clouded and most of the time it's hard to think. Noticing these side effects I decided to look into it online and it seems that it's not too uncommon for people to feel these effects on the medication and people say that the medication worked for them even though they started with similar side effects and to stick through the first few weeks. At this point, I am really hoping that something comes out of dealing with these side effects but honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if yet another medication does nothing for me. I'm starting to wonder if I have treatment-resistant depression and after looking into that I am feeling even more hopeless and stressed out. If any of you have any advice especially if you have taken Bupropion I would be really thankful as I'm starting to feel like this is my reality and will never be improved. As a side note, I wanted to mention that I do apologize if my post is too long or hard to understand it kind of turned into a bit of a rant and telling these details is still fairly difficult for me.",1

I've experienced things this past week that I didnt think I ever would. My kids are having the time of their lives. I should be happy.
Depression. A word that I've struggled with for most of my life. ""I don't suffer from that. I'm not crazy."" I've never been able to admit to myself that I suffer from mental illness. Until now.
I'm pushing 40. I'm married with two beautiful children. I have an okay job that I've been at for 14 years and I'm a homeowner. I should be happy.
I struggle with anger. The smallest things set me off. Driving brings out rage. Something doesn't go right. Rage. Things get thrown, my basement walls have the battle scars of my fists. After every explosion, I come back to earth with feelings of shame and remorse. There's no physical abuse in my house, but my kids are afraid of me.
Growing up, dad was a drunk. A mean drunk. Not so much physically abusive, but when he was drunk, he'd spit his venom at my mom, sister and I. He ended up losing his job (for drinking) and my parents split. From the time I was 12 my mom would work up to three jobs at a time. I spent a lot of time alone when I was a teenager. My sister was much older and moved out at 17. I didnt have too many friends through high school and was, more or less, a loser. I learned to cook for myself at a young age and was alone while mom was at work in the afternoons and nights.
I was molested by an older boy when I was 5 or 6. I can't remember most of the details, but I know it happened. More than once.
Self loathing. I hate myself. I mean, I fucking hate myself. I've struggled with weight for most of my life. Up and down. I have man boobs. I remember being made fun of as a child for it. I was with my wife for nearly two years before she saw me without a shirt on. We had a child before she saw me without a shirt on. I love swimming. I can count on one hand the amount of times I've swam since I was 13. I see myself in the mirror and I wish for death. Constantly. I'm disgusted by my being. 
Thoughts in my head: ""You're garbage. You're a piece of shit. You're disgusting. You're a fat waste of space."" You get the idea.
I have very high levels of stress and anxiety. All the time. I'm worried about everything and I mean everything. 
I've managed pretty well for most of my life. Keeping things in check. Keeping things together whilst being plagued by worry, anxiety, depression and anger. I rarely drink. As of late I've been using (legal) marijuana as a coping mechanism. 
I was really anxious about this trip that I'm on. Swimming. Fuck. This whole episode started at the beginning of January when I started thinking about this trip. I hit rock bottom with depression and suicidal ideation. I didnt talk to anyone in my family for days. I even started making exit plans. One of my family members helped me along and I was starting to feel better. I even went to my doctor and had a couple meetings with the office counselor. (This was extremely hard for me to do)
Me: I'm a disgusting man and I hate myself
Counselor: I know lots of people that are unhappy with their bodies. 
Well shit. That fixes everything. These meetings were a colossal waste of time.
Since January I've had good and bad days. The bad outnumbering the good by a large margin. I have never in my life felt so out of control as I have these past couple of months. I feel like everything is unravelling. 
My wife. I can't talk to her. It feels like she doesn't want to hear it. She doesn't want to listen. She's emotionally distant. No hugs or kisses in my marriage. Hugging her is awkward. Yeah you read that right. Hugging and kissing my fucking wife is awkward. She's amazing with our children, like a 10/10 mom. Myself,  I feel like I have a roommate. I don't feel loved and it hurts so bad. I've tried talking to her about it many times but nothing changes. I see other married couples holding hands, hugging and kissing and it rips me to shreds. 
I've never been medicated. I've never been properly diagnosed. And I've never really talked about it. As I mentioned earlier, I've been pretty good at holding things together. I just can't do it anymore.
Standing on the deck, I look down into the black waters and picture myself jumping in to my death. Just climb over the railing and after a few minutes, I'll be like Sonic the Hedgehog in the water levels. Falling into the abyss. Sitting in the room, I think about tying my belt around my neck and closing it in the top of the bathroom door. I haven't attempted suicide before but that doesn't stop me from thinking about it all the time. Almost anything I see, I think about how I can use it to kill myself. I'm terrified of these dark thoughts.
My oldest child knows that something's not right. He's overheard conversations I've had with my wife and he's been really upset. Its reminding me about how I felt when I was his age. I feel powerless to stop it. I get so down on myself and say horrible things about myself and I see how it hurts him and its killing me to see him cry. I love him so much and I'm breaking him and I want to die even more when I think about it.
I think my kids are the only reason I'm still here (certainly isn't my wife).
I'm tired. I'm tired of the pain.I don't know how much longer I can keep it together. I'm so fucked up.
I'm on an amazing vacation. I've experienced amazing things in the past week. I should not feel this way. 
I'm so tired....
TLDR: I hate myself and want to die.

People will talk to me for a couple days and then I guess they realize how weird I am or I seem too needy and desperate and then they just disappear.

I have no friends and go days at a time without really talking to people. And if someone does actually take the time to talk back to me, I get so excited that I talk to them so much that they will get sick of me. I'm too honest and I overshare my emotions and thoughts. I just dont know what to do other than try and get used to being alone. I feel broken.",1
test_pid_1035,"My rant (Long post) : I (17F) need to rant a bit because I can't really say the things I'm about to say to anyone else in my life. lol
Go back 2 years ago from today and everything was mostly fine. I had great friends, a loving partner, and a family that I thought truly cared for me.
In March of 2018, my boyfriend and I broke up due to trust issues. A month later, one of my friends moves far away due to issues in her family. I haven't heard from her since. In May of 2018, all hell broke loose. My friends started to fight and argue with each other constantly, and I was basically the ""bridge"" between them. My family started to turn against me, yelling at me for not doing anything useful with myself. My anxiety shot through the roof and I started getting sick (extreme weight loss, hair loss, fatigue, etc.). I think this might have been the cause. I just know that nothing was the same after that month.
Weak ties with my family members. Two friends out of my life. Eventually, my ex-boyfriend and I had a talk, and we ended our connection on a good note.. But he and his family moved out of the city, and we never talked again. Meanwhile, my remaining friends are still fighting. That shit builds up emotionally.
Skip to November of 2018. I started dating one of my close friends who was (unfortunately) one of the main sources of drama at the time. He convinced me to cut ties with my female best friend, who may or may not have only kept me around for her benefit. I didn't want to do it, but I could barely even think clearly.. I was physically and mentally sick from my constant anxiety. I had broken most of my social connections in just one year and I felt like a piece of shit every day.
Fortunately, I'm doing a lot better now. I'm no longer physically sick, and I'm rarely anxious anymore. But damn, I still feel horrible at the end of each day. Here are some reasons why:
\- I think I might be bipolar (I'm angry for 5 days, then an emotional ""high"" for 3-4 days, repeated)
\- My family hates my boyfriend and they don't want me talking to him because they don't trust him at all (we're also long distance atm)
\- I'm angry over almost everything
\- I'm lonely
\- I hate myself and I don't have a job (or skills)
\- If I tell my family anything like this, they fucking mock me (I've tried, believe me)
I don't really like complaining but I just can't hold back anymore. If this keeps going on I'll just kill myself in the end. I have so much and yet I still hate life.
I could kill myself now and nobody would notice until 16 hours after. But I'm a coward, so.. lol",1
test_pid_1036,"I can't trust in nobody, even if that person it's me. : I'm feeling always alone and miserable.  
The only person in my family, my sister, I have trusted in her, she just played with my trust and feelings.  
But, I know it's my fault because, I trusted in her and that was my fucking mistake.  
But I said ok, I have my friends.  
The only really two friends I have, are my cyber friends but they long ago do not connect and I'm feeling hopeless and without love.  
Weeks ago, a cute and gorgeous girl said me I'm her crush and I was feeling so happy, I was feeling with hope.  
But yea, that shit it's over, she said me a week ago she not feeling prepared for a relationship and that it's okay, now we are friends but that really hurt me. I can understand still, but the pain was horrible, I'm feeling I'm a fucking boring person.  
I want friends but just I don't know I can't, sometimes some people said me I'm a good person but not a good friend, lol.

All my friends( well most of them) are either getting drunk or high messing with females dropping out of high school and I just feel lonely. I don’t have Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, I’m truly alone in my mind. My mind will forever be my worst enemy. I have a low self esteem even though I get compliments from females. It’s just hard I don’t know what to say. When I was young I never thought I would be like this always comparing my self to others or having mental breakdowns and I don’t know who to go to. I can’t go to my friends cause they’ll think less of me and judge me, I can’t go to my family because they’ll think I’m crazy, you might say I need a psychiatrist but I don’t want to because people will find out.

test_pid_1040,"A reminder that no matter how awful things seem, there will always be something that makes you happy : I’ve been feeling really hopeless recently, and I didn’t even have enough energy to want to die. I just sat where I was and repeated “I can’t do this” for 10 minutes straight. When I opened my eyes, I saw a shirt on my floor that my dad gave me last year, that he wore for almost 2 decades and consequently was very comfortable to have on. Seeing his shirt brought the thought that, no matter how bad I get, and no matter what mood my dad is in, he is still going to love me. It didn’t immediately cure my depression and make me start dancing around my house, but it definitely helped to counter that utterly hopeless feeling. I wore that shirt when I went to sleep that night, and for the first time in a while, I was able to keep it together while I fell asleep. 
I know a lot of you have probably felt similar to me before, and I know how stupid it feels to have someone tell you to “just think positive!” When all you want to do is quietly fade away into nothing, but please, next time you feel like you’ve hit rock bottom, or even when you haven’t and you just aren’t feeling too good, find one thing, any one thing, no matter how small or seemingly meaningless it is, that makes you happy. 
I’m not asking you to write a 12 page, bullet-noted dissertation on the meaning of happiness and how to strive for it, I’m just asking you to find one small thing that makes you laugh, smile, blow air out your nose, or even just feel slightly less depressed. If you can’t do it for yourself, do it for me. 
All the love,

I just wanted to reach out to a bunch of internet strangers to share something and just have some people write back. Lonely I guess. Will probably delete later.
I’ve struggled with depression my whole life and to be honest, I thought I had it beat. Life’s been good lately. Then on Sunday night I had a nightmare. In my nightmare I was homeless but I was homeless in the neighborhood that my parents live in. I was purposely avoiding my parents but ended up deciding I would just go home but there was a lot of shame associated with it. For context I’m a 36 year old dude, married with a toddler with a job and home and security.
On Monday morning when I woke up my mood was off. My wife immediately noticed and asked what was wrong and I couldn’t even say exactly why. It’s been a rough week. Tired all the time. Off mood, craving for sugar. Tonight I feel particularly down. No reason in particular except for this stupid dream that kicked it all off. I don’t even know what the dream meant but I can’t help but wonder what my brain was telling me or trying to process.
It was one of those nightmares that you wake up from saying to yourself “oh thank goodness it was just a dream”.

test_pid_1048,"How can I help? : Preemptive sorry for long post
About 3-4 years ago in my sophomore year of high school, I got really close to a group of friends that I am still actively in contact with even though most of us went to different colleges.  We talked about everything; Childhood traumas, bullies, kinks, period timing (Some of the things I DIDN'T need to know about...). Almost anything you can think of, we have opened up enough to talk about it to each other.  I was normally the person who people came to for comfort whenever something happened, be it a breakup or a fight with a parent.  I was really honored because I always thought that I could handle almost any situation that came to me because I thought I could be a neutral voice of reason that could calm them down.  Well recently(within the past couple months), one of my friends, lets name her Dee, was not doing amazingly well mentally and since I was in high school at the time, I was perfectly willing to volunteer most of my free time to help her because high school wasn't too much of a problem for me.  Whenever we talked she would hint at things like how her parents treated her and how life just was not worth living for her.  I chose, at the time, to not delve too deep into her past way before I met her and I was waiting for her to open up and tell me what was wrong by herself without me prying the information from her.  A few months go by and she calls me to notify me that she has a new girlfriend that she wants to introduce to me.  I think it is just splendid that she found someone that she likes and went to meet them right away after I was invited over for a weekend.  The girl was very sweet and I had no problems with her dating my ""daughter"" Dee.  I left them feeling that this was a good sign! That this was going to be a potential for her to finally open up to someone new and get past some of her past traumas.  
Sadly I was mistaken as almost a week later I get a Skype call and get greeted by the face of a bawling Dee, talking hysterically about how much she wanted to kill herself and how much she hated being alive.  A whole hour and a half later of Minecraft (this is the choice game of our friend group) and calm music I was able to calm her down.  Following that, after calming down enough to talk, the conversation went something like this(I don't have the actual conversation because it was during a Skype call):
Me: So what is wrong? Did something happen to you? Did your girlfriend do/say something?
Dee: No, she didn't do anything. I just don't know anymore.
Me: So what triggered this? What happened to cause you to cry like this?
Dee: I don't know.  
And that was the end of the conversation on that before she went to divert the subject to something else.  In the past, I have picked up that from her past she has had multiple times where she was sexually assaulted by her father and I have personally been at her house when her family were yelling at her, calling her many names that were extremely inappropriate.  Could the girlfriend situation have reignited that trauma in her mind? This whole situation was new to me as I was never used to seeing this reaction to ""nothing"" before.  
My question is: What can I do to help someone who doesn't seem to know what is wrong, or doesn't want to tell me what is wrong?  I have pushed her into finally getting a councilor after almost 7 months of pushing her.  Should I have taken a step back and let her function on her own?  Almost everyday now she just says she feels like crying, or something along the lines of ""I don't want to go to school anymore"".  It really pains me to see her like this and I just don't know what to do to help her feel better. 
TL;DR : Friend has a breakdown and I don't know what to do to help them in their time of need.",1
test_pid_1049,I hate being there for other people when no one’s there for me. : I’m so fucking tired of being there emotionally (and financially) for other people when other people won’t give me the time of day.

test_pid_1051,"Vent : Every time I go into public I always feel judged. No matter where I am, except for home when I’m locked into my room. In public you can clearly see the amount of anxiety I’m in, like I’m about to go into a full blown panic attack. I feel like I’m judged like if I go to target. I don’t have a car so I ride my bike. I don’t have a bike lock, so every time I go somewhere it’s like “look at that teenager, stealing shit again. What is wrong with people,” or “he’s wearing a hoodie, he probably has something in his pockets. I should tell someone,”.
I have a job. Still a sophomore. It’s high amount of stress. I work at a grocery store, lots of heavy things to lift. Because I can “get the job done” I’m always doing things I hate. I can’t show any signs of depression there, managers will report me to the boss. I have to always be nice but when I make small talk, it comes off as super awkward.
I can easily hold onto my rage, but sometimes it just wants to burst out of me. I want to hit a wall of drywall.
School has me stressed out more then anything. Grades are dropping. One of my teachers basically called me a disappoint because I use my phone as a coping technique. He doesn’t do this to anyone but me. Just to humiliate me. 
I’m a male. I know “oh look he’s  male. Another self hating white guy, so predictable ”. The world keeps getting more and more violent and is going more and more crazy. People lying just for attention, driving people with real depression driven to the bottom. 
I’m CONSTANTLY being begged to do stuff. Sometimes very tiny stuff that people are to lazy to do. Like, letting the dogs in. My sister walks right past the back door to get to her room. I get yelled at across the house to “let the dogs in/out” I keep feeling more and more a tool. Something to keep around the house to only use and gets yell if it doesn’t work. Sometimes it’s so small a two year old can do it, and someone yelling at me to do it. If I say “you can do it” because I’m fed up with everyone ones shit, but then one of my parents yell at me do it or else, or my sister makes a HUGE deal out of it.
The only person that actually respects me is my aunt. She actuality cares.

test_pid_1053,"I’m used as a tool just for people to use and get mad at. : I posted a rant a little while ago, I’m posting a story but was too long for it, so I’ll write it here.
One time we took our dog to the vet, he got a shot and because he’s the biggest drama queen we had to take him. His leg was acting up. He also likes a certain spot to hide: under my bed. One time I was sitting on the couch (my parents were next door) and was screaming about something, I was playing on my phone at the time, not exactly tuning into what she was saying. The dog made a b-line for under my bed. As I went to retrieve him my sister followed me and was making a big hissy fit about “to not touch her dog” as she kept punching me. I pull the dog out as kindly as possible to not hurt him, mean while my sister was still wailing on me. She snatched the dog from my hands and was making a big deal. (My sister is 3years older then me) I flew into a blind rage. I was done letting people take control of me and I was still trying to maintain control, and all I did was push her. Parents came back over soon, I explained what happened. If I do something wrong I own up to what I did. I tell the truth and from what I could remember.
My sister? Nah ain’t having any of that shit. She flat out lies to my parents and my parents side with her. She’s a stone cold bitch and always gets what she wants no matter what. She started spouting out about, “as soon as she got in the doors [me] started beating her up”. Remember all I did was push her and yell. My parents know I’m not the one to do that. I want things as peaceful and as quiet at possible. I barley act out of place for fear of being yelled at and disturbing the peace I have in my mind. I tried to disprove that statement but I kept getting talked over like I always do, because you know why? I’m not a unimportant fuck, that’s why.

test_pid_1073,"yikes this is long and boring : Hi. How's it going, everyone?
I've been confused as to how to feel for a long time now. I don't quite know whats wrong with me, if anything. For a while now, I've had an underlying feeling that something was wrong, but I've never been able to put my finger on it. I'm a 16 year old sophomore, attending a Midwest private high school. To most, it would seem I have everything I could ever want at my fingertips; a car (which I did *not* have to pay for), a loving mom, a dad I can see on the weekends, and a significant other that seems to genuinely enjoy my company. I have a small friend circle, but not too small. I suspect that I'm suffering from depression, but I'm not 100% certain. This makes it hard to talk to others about everything as I'm afraid that anyone I talk to regarding it is going to mock me, and belittle me for being over-dramatic. It is for that reason that I haven't requested a therapist/psychiatrist, although I know that it would be beneficial. I guess I'm just worried people are going to label me as ""just another fake depressed teen.""
I was diagnosed with ADHD (primarily inattentive) about a year and a half ago, and have been lucky (depending on how you look at it) enough to receive medication for my disorder. I have, and still do question my ADD diagnosis. When I was originally diagnosed with ADD my doctor recommended putting me on medication that was supposed to sharpen my focus and help my inattentiveness. I was put on Dexmethylphenidate first, with little to no signs of improvement. I'm not sure how long I took Focalin (Dexmethylphenidate) for, but it wasn't incredibly long. At our 3 month check-up (I think..? I'm not entirely sure, my memory of the past is basically nonexistent anymore.) my doctor recommended that I try a different medication and see if I noticed improvement. We took her advise and she prescribed me Adderall XR 15mg. When I heard this, I was excited. I started taking the medication and at first, noticed an immediate improvement. This improvement stayed as I took the medication for about a month to a month and a half. Then, things started going downhill. I noticed the medication wasn't helping quite as much as it had been in the beginning, and it was quite saddening for me. I learned how to take the capsules apart and turn them into an instant release version, essentially doubling the potency. I did this a few times, but eventually stopped as I was too bothered to do it anymore.
I don't even know how long ago that was, its as if my brain cannot force itself to see that far into the past. Regardless of that, I had my Adderall dosage upped within the past two months, including a new instant release add-on for the afternoon, which still doesn't seem to help all that much. I still have trouble finding the motivation to complete and turn in school assignments, as I did in the past. I don't know what causes this, but I feel like I have a clue (hence why I'm posting in this sub).
Half way through November of 2019, I crashed my car. I was leaving school on my way home, and the roads were icy. I was taking a very sharp corner far too fast for the conditions, (even though it was only about 15mph) sliding directly into a guardrail. I wasn't wearing a seat belt, but that wasn't a concern. I put my little Nissan Sentra in reverse and backed out of the ditch. Thankfully, nobody witnessed the fuck up. I pulled off to the side of the road and inspected the damage. I smashed my right headlight, put a large dent in my hood, scraped up the bumper, and busted the grill. There was no structural damage, and the repair costs weren't astronomical, but after that day I developed a fear for that bend in the road.  Every time I went past the corner I couldn't help but replay the memory in my mind, and I still can't to an extent, 5 months later. I'm including this event in my post as I believe it was the major tipping point for my anxiety. Prior to this incident I had dealt with very little perceived anxiety, and was normally very easygoing. It was as if something changed in my brain. Like a light switch, waiting to be flipped.
About 4 months ago, I took up frequent marijuana use. I never really smoked huge amounts of weed, but I smoked at every opportunity. I considered it my medication. It calmed me down, and made the once lonely and boring nights seem bearable. Two weeks in, I wanted nothing but to smoke weed and chill. I stopped picking my girlfriend up from school occasionally (as she goes to a different school than I do) and fell into a bad place. I was coming to school high, and my friends could tell. They noticed I was more social and seemed happy in the first few hours of the day, but they also noticed the zombie-like me that stumbled around the hallways and looked visibly sad during the latter half of the day. I would drive home after school everyday and smoke a bowl first thing just to make life more bearable. I got to the point where I told myself ""I'd rather die than stay sober for a week."" Don't get me wrong, weed can be fucking amazing. *I love it.* It's just about as safe as fucking Advil, and it feels great, (Yes, I realize it isn't good for the maturing teen prefrontal cortex.) but I recognized I was forming a very bad habit mental health wise. When I was sober I craved more, and lost what little motivation I had before.
6 weeks into my habit, I began facing some difficulties in my relationship. My significant other was and still is extremely against marijuana. I find it repulsive that she can't be open minded to the idea of it, but its whatever. Anyway. While I was high, I found it incredibly easy to show affection to her, and it made cuddling (her favorite activity) genuinely amazing. This was all great, but the problems came when I was sober. I was increasingly apathetic when I was sober, more so than ever before. It was almost like I couldn't feel any emotions anymore. I hated it. So I did what any rational person would've done, and smoked more weed! I was spending upwards of 30 dollars a week on high quality bud from my dealer. Not only was I spending more money, I was spending less time with my girlfriend. As time went on, I was spending like 2 days a week with her versus our normal 5 days a week together. It may have made me a little sad that I wasn't spending as much time with her, but I was alright, I was too high to care!
But then, I wasn't.
About two weeks later, my dad decided he needed the spare grill for some truck he owned. I have no clue why, maybe he was just looking for some excuse to poke around in my trunk, because he did. I guess I had left my car unlocked, which was my first mistake. He opened the trunk via the switch inside the car and I assume was greeted with the pungent smell of burnt weed and dirty pipe. He laid my stash out on the grill of my car and called me outside to look at all of my weed and weed paraphernalia. Something had told me it wasn't gonna be a good day as soon as I woke up that day, and man was that something right. I told the truth about it all, such as how I was self-medicating with it. My dad, being an alcoholic, wasn't able to punish me severely without being a hypocrite. He did take my brand new glass pipe I had bought literally a day before, about 2gs of trash weed I got with the pipe, and my lighters though, which was the worst punishment of them all. I also lost my car for like 2 weeks other than to and from school.
My doctor prescribed me Clonidine, an off-label sleep medication. I sleep alright now I guess, but nights are still difficult. I can't hardly get out of bed anymore, generally I have to take my Adderall to even get up. I don't think that's normal. As of recently I've been researching designer benzos such as Etizolam and Clonazolam trying to find something that I can use in place of weed. I feel as if I need marijuana or some similar substance to correct my bland life. I only ever find intense pleasure and a sense of well-being when I'm at least a little high. I feel like I've fallen into a depressive stupor, and I haven't been able to claw my way out for weeks. I've been exhibiting depressive tendencies, and I don't know what to do. We're all depressed. Everyone is, in my opinion. Its obvious to me, everyone is depressed, so whats the point in talking about it? Its not like anything is gonna get better, if anything its only getting worse.
I hate to think like this, but I'm afraid its the only way to make things bearable. I try my best not to think a good majority of the time, just so I don't encounter these troublesome thoughts. Hopefully things *do* get better.. I'll be waiting for when they do. Maybe this is all just part of growing up, hormones or something. If so, damn, I wish I didn't have to grow up.

I am a young highschool student and my life is hell right now, I’m failing online school, friendships, and overall just life. I usually spend ever day in my bed just laying there. I haven’t left my house and months and I feel like I am just dead. But tonight something happened. I am usually up every night do to insomnia. So I was staring at things in my room and saw my makeup and thought I would play with it. I haven’t done anything like this in forever. I was randomly playing with eyeshadow when I thought of doing a full face of makeup. So I did and then I thought I would put On an outfit for fun. I put one on which  I haven’t done in months. I live in the same two outfits. So here is the interesting part.... keep in mind months ago I tried getting all dressed up to see how I would feel and it lead to hours of crying. But this time I looked in the mirror and I saw myself. I was surprised I haven’t felt like I’m myself for awhile. I felt absolutely beautiful. Then it hit me I’m alive, I’m not dead I am a living person. And the past me before all the depression and anxiety hit, wouldn’t want me to die. I can’t slowly kill myself. Because I am alive. I started to cry happy tears and stared at myself. It was the same me I saw before I gave up. I didn’t think I would ever see this me agian. It was a bit trippy be a i didn’t feel like I was even looking at myself just a beautiful stranger in away... yet it was me. Of course I only wore the outfit and makeup for 15 minutes then took a shower. Other wise I would of had an anxiety attack. But the point is I got up only if it was just for a second. And I think that you should try this. It may take a couple try’s where you have a breakdown. But it could lead to you felling like you agian. I also want you to know that even if it’s deep deep down there is a small piece of you or your past self that wants you to be alive. Because slowly killing yourself is only going to make you feel worse. And ending it won’t allow that piece of you to grow until your able to get back up. I know how hard life is but if we try it will be easier. i don’t have bipolar depression but I have moments where I am bipolar. So sometimes I will feel like this and the hit rock bottom but I am now realizing that I have to climb up agian even if I keep falling. I need to keep climbing and so do you.

test_pid_1083,"How am I supposed to react to this? : I started seriously talking to this friend at work just after Thanksgiving. She was actually the first and only person I've ever told about my depression, and she was so nice and understanding about it that I started to feel something for her.

She still talks to everyone else, but she doesn't want anything to do with me anymore.
How am I supposed to feel? She actually seemed genuinely interested in me, talking about how she misses me when I'm not there, I'm the reason she goes to work, and that I helped her past the trust issues she got after her previous relationship ended. A co-worker told me yesterday that she found a boyfriend, which I don't mind. I really just want to keep my best friend, but she's avoiding me without so much as a goodbye.
What do I do? She told me she had trust issues and now she's given me them.

The only family support I have is a manipulative mom that I am now taking care of. That is really difficult to say. Everything is raw. I don't know what to do with it all. Yes I am on medication.

I lost my health. I lost the friends that displayed their true character. Losing your friends when you have no family is devastating. I lost my career which I have sacrificed everything for. I am now so far behind I honestly don't know if I can ever catch up. My career was my life. It was my way of proving my worth to myself, to fight depression. It distracted me from the lack of family support that I've lived without my entire life in denial. 
I was protecting myself through dissociation for so long I don't know how to cope with this reality. I feel so alone. So now here it all is. All at once. And every day it seems to make less sense as I unpack it all. I just feel like such a mess despite all the efforts I am making.

I became friends with this girl a few months ago. We’re in the same university but we weren’t close prior to this academic year when another friend of mine introduced us. We got on really well since we have a lot in common and we see each other pretty much every day in uni. She’s quite shy and doesn’t share her feelings that often and even though she has never said explicitly that she’s depressed I know she is. She’s failed her last assignment not because she’s not smart but because she just hasn’t done enough work. If she fails another one there is a chance she won’t pass this year.
We were celebrating a friends birthday a few days ago and at one point she rolled up her sleeves a little bit and I saw the scars. I had no idea she self-harmed before. For a second I was trying to decide whether I should say something or not but then I just grabbed her wrist and she asked me if I want to talk outside so we went. I couldn’t tell if the scars were old so my immediate question was if she still does it and she said yes. She’s told me she’s been doing it since primary school and that she’s tried to stop many times but she always ends up doing it again. Now, I know people self-harm for different reasons so I asked her what was hers and she said it’s kind of like a stress-relief. She has also apologised a few times that I “had to see it”.
I have never been in that kind of situation before so I didn’t know how to approach it but this is what I said pretty much: I asked her if anyone from her family knows and she said her mum does but not that she still does it. I told her there is no need to apologise and that this doesn’t change how I feel about her and that I just want to see her get better. I asked her if she’s seeing anyone because I know she used to but stopped a while ago and she said she’s signed up for therapy and is going to her first session next month. Lastly, I told her I’m there for her is she needs to talk to someone.
Is there anything else I could’ve said/done? Or anything else I can do now with this information? Regarding her grades, I know she has an extension so her tutors must know there is something that stops her from doing work. Also, she’s 21 if anyone’s wondering.

My parents' agenda is for me to stay with them forever, so they always downplay how well I can take care of myself. I'm too scared to live alone because i might actually die.
But yet, theres so much going well for me (super good job, loving friends, supportive family) and I feel stupid for even feeling this way, and feeling like I'm lazy because I'm falling behind on my hobbies. I'm also often told that I should be grateful and then I feel even worse.
With all that being said, life really does feel like swimming in an ocean. Sometimes, the waves are calm and you swim, you get somewhere. Sometimes, the waves drag you down and you start drowning, and the more you drown the less you can struggle. Sometimes, your friends save you, or you find a small island to rest on temporarily. I'm tired of swimming.

test_pid_1122,"I promised myself I would kill myself if I was still alone on my 30th birthday. I still am. : I have no friends in real life to talk too, so this will be my farewell letter.
I have been alone for my entire life. I never had a girlfriend. I took advice from both the internet and actual therapists, clothing, haircut, keeping fit, joining clubs based around activities that interest me, you know the drill. I'm not disliked at all, people that have to sit next to me in school/at work have no problem with me. But the moment agenda doesn't put us in the same room, people forget me, be it the people from school, clubs, work. I'm just not interesting enough to make people wish to continue talking to me, be it as friends or anything else, to them I'm just a secondary character in the background, and by now I agree with it.
My 30th birthday was some time ago, I'm not even sure why I didn't do it as I promised myself, self-preservation instinct I guess. I promised to myself when I was 21/22 that I would try what there is to try to get out of my loneliness, with 30 as a time limit. I feel like I'm the same lost kid that didn't knew how to make friends, lagging so far behind on basic human skills that I'm a manchild that can't really understand when adults talk about aspects of their lives.
I know 30 is supposed to be young. I was told at 17 that I was young and still had time, same as 22, same as 27. I never felt young. I feel like I've been trying to do something out of my youth for 30 years and failing at it. I have no memories of outings with friends or destinations that made me wonder. I traveled a lot, went out to events that interested me, watched the stars in forgotten places with no lights around. I did all of this alone, and it wasn't worth it. I feel tired, not young, the same I felt at 17, 22 and all the subsequent years. I gave it time as I was advised ""you're young, you'll find someone/friends"". I gave it more than a decade, and after a while it just feels old. 
30 years sounds like the good time limit to me, a good point to look back upon your life and think about what has been done and what to do next and enough experience under the belt to know a bit better who you are, what you are and what you can do. Having spent them alone, it's a fair conclusion that it's not going to change in the next decade or afterwards. At my best form and with the most positive attitude I had, I never managed get a meaningful relationship with someone, be it as friend or more. Most people my age know better what they want in love, are married or divorced, have kids or are planning to do so, the usual. I'm lagging behind, I don't know the first thing about relationships and I doubt that someone knowing what they're looking for is going to bother with the bumbling steps of a manchild. 
I grew up and missed a basic part of the human condition, and it has gone for long enough. Living life lonely is not worth it. It wasn't a few years back, it isn't now, the only difference is I feel I should have spared myself the torture of the previous years, when I still had hope. So I filled the void with anything I could find, work, writing a lot, reading, sports, whatever. But it just doesn't act as a crutch anymore.
My social life is empty. I did most activities alone, and after a while of not being able to share it with anyone, it just hurts.
My artistical life is empty. I wrote a lot and took courses since I was 15, but I barely got any better.
My professional life is about the only thing I managed well, I build prosthesis/orthesis for amputated/disabled people, it pays well and there's no shortage of work and at least it's useful. That's the one thing I managed. In 30 years of life, I managed to have a good job. And that's it. 
Enough is enough, I'm calling it quits. I researched the methods and have been practising one that fits me. I don't want to suffer for another decade just for a slight chance of sharing a meaningful moment with someone. 
If I can wish you one thing: be foolish, make some mistakes, doesn't need to be extreme stuff, just get out of your comfort zone to have some good or wacky memories to have something to tell about your life, lest you end like me and wonder what you've done in all these years.",1

Last night I tried smoking some weed thinking it would help change my mood or something. To try and make me feel anything else really than my general uninterest in things or severe loneliness. To be completely honest with you, if you were to tell me I might have a drug problem or maybe a history of substance abuse you'd be about half right. I don't really do drugs as often as I used to. When I was in high school I remember a time where I smoked like maybe 5-10 joints a day and bought ounces every other few days or so. These days I smoke maybe about .2 grams a month if even that. Sometimes I go entire months without smoking even once. A lot of it is because I can't spare the funds to do it and I never really felt like it was something I depended on. Back in high school I was extremely stressed out and did it recreationally a little too much but nowadays I lack the friends to even do it with and every time I do it's by myself at night.

I decided I was gonna smoke a very insignificant amount, like maybe 2-4 pulls and clip the blunt because I didn't want to get too high. After I finished doing so I started working on my PC because I was trying to install mac on a VM because I needed to use the OS for something in relation to my iphones jailbreak. I started finding myself unable to focus on what I was doing even though I was reading the instructions out in my head and even out loud at some point because I noticed a second set of thoughts racing through my head that made it really hard to focus.
And then it happened. Suddenly this intense and spontaneous rush of negative thoughts completely overwhelmed my brain. I felt like I was being overloaded and began experiencing a rapid change in my heart rate as well as beat skipping and even pulsating physical pains as my heart continued to accelerate. I felt a rush of adrenaline as thoughts like ""Imagine if you died."" or ""You should just kill yourself"" began to rapidly fill my head. I started feeling a shortness of breath, in fact I felt like any deep breath I would tried to take would lead to my heart exploding. I literally felt like at any second I was going to have a heart attack. I constantly held my hand to my chest and sometimes stood there in shock because I thought it happened, I thought my heart stopped or something or was going to. My first instinct was to try my best to calm down and drown out the negativity. I began talking to myself out loud trying to tell myself things like reasons I should live and that is not actually how I feel and I should relax. I told myself things like I have a family, and a loving mother who would be really sad if I were gone. I tried everything I could to help myself realize that these negative thoughts filling my head were not how I truly felt.
Sometimes it worked. I began to breathe slowly and my heart rate would slow and it temporarily subsided. I then sat down and tried continuing to work to distract myself from the experience but eventually it just came back and even worse. I literally jumped out of my seat holding back the urge to scream or run out of my room and tell someone I feel like I'm dying. My heart was beating so fast It scared me to try and even feel it because i felt like even a mere touch to my chest was going to stop my heart. 
Things began getting really weird. I felt like I was possessed. For some reason I just started envisioning ways to kill myself, like a scene playing in my head of me literally walking to the kitchen and grabbing a knife and doing who knows what with it. At one point I'm pretty sure I heard whispers or something. My mind was just playing tricks with me and I felt like I was arguing with another version of myself.
It got to a point where I had to text or call someone. I ended up texting my brother in law in an attempt to calm myself down by letting him know how I've been generally feeling. I didn't want to tell him the exact situation I was in because I don't want to worry anyone as I still felt strong enough to overcome the situation because only a few nights before, the same thing happened.
After texting with him for a bit I began to calm down more and I also downloaded an app on my phone to help monitor my heart rate and try more breathing exercises to calm down. After I was finally over the high I started realizing that my heart rate does tend to rise pretty quickly even when I'm just resting. I also felt like these past few months, due to how inactive I am generally or how unhealthy I eat that these may be heart palpitations or something similar. I'm no doctor, but these past few weeks my chest and my heart especially have been making me feel generally uncomfortable. Even as I type this now I felt a weird tightness near the left side of my chest that I can't help but periodically touch with my palm to check on my heart rate. 
After this experience I've finally made a personal decision that I fully intend to keep. I used to be the kind of guy who didn't mind drinking or doing LSD or smoking weed and even thought about trying DMT soon. But now I really don't think I have any intention to use or especially abuse substances anymore because I am genuinely concerned for my health and I just really don't want to die. I may not feel happy all the time. I may not be as social or even as healthy as I used to but I'm not suicidal, or at least the real me, not the drugged up me, isn't. 
*I genuinely want to get help but I'm having a hard time doing so. The last time I looked up my health insurance information to find a psychiatrist or therapist or something like that in my area that would accept my health insurance all I ever seem to get is the run around with voice machines that tell me to call other voice machines and never get anyone on the line that I can get to make an actual appointment with. It got to a point where I just gave up and thought I could figure things out on my own and even though I did for a while I feel like I can't afford to take that risk anymore.* 
*I am really desperately trying to find a doctor in the NYC area, preferably Manhattan that will take Empire Bluecross Blueshield insurance. I'm sorry if I may be putting too many personal info here but I would just really like some kind of assistance in getting help. I have absolutely no problem making the calls I need and physically going to the locations I need to go but I could just use some direction.* 
*I really need things to change. I can't stand the thought of seeing my mother cry again from being concerned about my well being. In fact I'm tearing up now just even thinking about it. I can't let this anxiety or depression or bi polar or what ever any of this is take control of my life.*
*I just want to get better.*",1
test_pid_1143,"I can't break out of this cycle of suffering : I've lasted 2 weeks without feeling anxiety and wanting to kill myself, I worked hard on studying some of the topics I find interesting, read books and spent very little time on my phone; went to sleep early and woke up early with little to no difficulty; took care of my hygiene regularly. But yesterday something happened like it usually does. I woke up feeling extremely tired even though I slept for 8 and a half hours. My body just wouldn't listen to me. I couldn't focus on anything. Taking a shower and brushing my teeth seemed like such a chore, reading was completely out of my reach. A little later I had a mental breakdown and was overwhelmed with existential dread, I really wanted to die at that moment. And now I'm back in this state of despair. Depression is back again.
Today I woke up with extreme difficulty and anxiety. I don't know what to do. I'm just 19. But ever since I graduated from school it's been pure torture. I can't find a job. I've tried everything, I hated every single one of the jobs I could land. I hate my country. I hate dealing with stupid people. My family doesn't understand me. Their ignorance and stupidity is driving me crazy. ""Laziness is your biggest problem"". What am I even struggling for? What goal am I working towards? My father's only joy in life is alcohol. He goes to the job he hates, just so he can get drunk in the evening. Is the same fate waiting for me? This town is filled with mindless clones. I hate it. But I can't move. I have no money. Even if I did, would it change anything? Is money really the problem? Or is it this world that's the problem? It's fucked up. I hate it. I just wish I was never born.
I have nobody I love. I just wish there was someone that needed me. Someone I could protect. Someone for the sake of whom I'd climb the Everest and fly to the moon. But there's no such person. That's just how humans are. Real life is nothing like books. Real life is disappointing. Real life is boring. I'm one of the many. There's no extraordinary goal for me to achieve. It's just a sandbox game with the only goal: ""survive"".
Sorry for wasting your time.",1
test_pid_1144,"What Drowning Feels Like : Sometimes I lie in my bed staring at the ceiling counting the sheeps in my head; counting the blessings. But I can only count the pets, how the trees dance when the wind blows. I tried to smile and started a conversation about the actress who broke up with her lover, and I laugh, and cringe, talking about nothing at all. I tried to get a job, working for years in this industry I am not really interested to pursue. I don't know the reason why I'm there, why I need the money, why I need to solve the machines' problems when I don't even know how to sort out my mind, myself. So I quit; tried to think about my life, tried to think of happy things so as not to think about suicide. I went to see the ocean. I went to see the mountains. I went to see other cities, and it was exhilarating. But I still feel empty. I don't know what to do and I'm running out of cash so I got a second job. I stayed for a little while and then I left. Here I am now, typing these words at the living room. The neighbors are blasting their music and my sister is brushing her teeth.
I tried to talk to someone, to everyone. But they don't understand. They only want the cars, and the big house, the money, and sex. They want to get married before the age of 30 to poop tiny little babies, and work their asses off in the jobs they hate, running, circling the system they don't know that is existing (or tried to pretend it's not there). I tried to date someone and I run off after the movie was finished. I'm not interested with anything or with anyone. I'm not interested with holding hands and sharing it in instagram.
I tried hurting myself by a cutter especially when I know I'm not being perfect. Back in college, I tried to cut my thighs when I failed an exam. I don't like my major but I don't want to fail. I stopped eventually. I got bored and I became disinterested about hurting myself. I tried social medias and it worked. For a while. But I got depressed more when I saw people posting their highlights while here I am, trying everyday to survive. I tried spending my time in youtube and netflix, and I watched a lot of videos and movies, and it was all meaningless.
I tried to plan and write down what I should do with my life but I lose interest after two days and really it's not worth it, I'm not worth it. I think I have bpd2. And anxiety. But I don't know. I don't wanna go to a psychiatrist. I wanna go. Would they really help? Or would they make it worse? 
What makes me sad is, I know that I have a brilliant mind and I know I'm wasting it away but I just can't get out of this fog, this grayness. I tried to love myself but I always end up loathing her.
I don't talk much nowadays. I created this distance with my friends who only want to see my sunny side, who looked away at my darkness. I rarely talk about mental health with my family because, really, they don't understand. ""It's just all negative thinking and you can surpass it with faith and positive thinking."" I gave up explaining a long time ago.
I keep changing my mind. In careers. I don't know what I want anymore. To be honest, I never see myself past the age of 30, maybe that's why.
I keep thinking of what will happen if I swallow a lot of sleeping pills, or the feel of the knife when I cut my wrists like how Hannah Baker did it in the tv series, or how it would feel like if you hang yourself or pull the gun's trigger, what would be the fastest and easiest way to die? What would be the less painful?
I'm dying. I know it. Something significant, something burning with light is dying inside me and the books, and the music don't help me anymore. At first they do, but now, I only feel this gaping maw. 
I tend to cry a lot when I was younger because I feel so deeply, the hurts and the joys are so intense. But I don't feel anything at all right now. Only this deep aching sadness. This deep ache of my existence.
It's funny really, because I can see how the people around me don't know that I'm drowning inside. They don't know I'm walking at this edge of this precipice, and I'm only waiting for the big trigger. I am so tired of all the triggers. I understand now how the people who killed themselves even surrounded by loved ones have done it. It is so easy to put a mask. 
And you know the worst part? I'm not afraid anymore. It's like I know the next stage is to give up and pull the trigger. I can still smile. I can still laugh and talk about things and pretend because I know that when I can't hold on anymore, I only need to let go.",1

I began throwing up and sweating profusely thinking I was going to die as my heart felt like it was going to pop, yet at that moment I felt as if I no longer had to keep going with my miserable life and felt not happy but relief. I figured I would take a vacation with my friends to alleviate my depression but when I was with my friends i knew since middle school, I couldn’t keep a conversation , I felt like I didn’t fit in even though they were my closest friends. As soon as I got home I tried to hang myself , I had the belt around my neck and was ready to drop from my ceiling fan but I was afraid my ceiling fan wouldn’t support my weight and break and my parents would come in and take note of what I was doing so I didn’t go through with it, I had my suicide letter ready and was close to taking my own life.

test_pid_1150,"Living Without Support : As I sit here begging the thoughts to slow down and just shut up and be quiet, I'm reminded of how bad it always manages to get and how I'm probably never gonna get better. I don't have anything I need to get better long term.
I'm jobless, in my early 20s living in a small community in my mother's house. I have debt collectors calling me every week. Only like 5 people in my family know I have a problem and none of them know I've tried to end it all. I'm atheist in a community of very religious individuals so nearly all support groups here are well intentioned but can't provide the connections I need. The nearest therapist I would even remotely trust going to lives 140 miles away. Not that it would matter, what with the lack of licences, car, and good insurance plan cover the cost. And the real cherry on top is knowing that I probably have something that needs medication to help correct, medication locked behind doctors notes.
I know the sadness comes and goes. But when it hits, it means business. The other day I found myself smiling and thinking to myself ""something is wrong here"". And then I realized I was happy AND the depression bag was no where in sight. It was a lovely fleeting thought. Happy for a day. Ready to fantasize about never need to worry or wake up again.
I did manage to get on pills one summer after I got in once to see someone at college. They completely killed all the creative and color in life. But at least I wasn't actively thinking about pill combination and how to disassemble my razor blade. But as long as I'm stuck living at home I'll never be able to get prescription for anymore.

test_pid_1151,"Don't wamt to go back but a can't go foward. : Do you ever hear people talking about how they wish they could go back to when they were kids? The fond memories, the childhood friends, the fun. The problem is I don't. Aside from a few bright spots my childhood was horrible. I changed schools every few years so I dont have any childhood friends. My family always struggled financialy. My dad was abusive when he was around but took off while I was in middle school. My mom, though she cared for us has made it hard.
The only thing that has kept me going is the light at the end of the tunnel. I've dreamed of space and becoming and engineer since middle school. Ive persued that dream despite all of the road blocks put in my way. I have payed my own way through college so far using grants, financial aid, and working almost full time (I am at a community college). This week I was accepted to an aerospace engineering undergraduate program at one of the top 40 public universities in the US and top 15 in the Western US. I cried with joy when I got it but now, 2 days later I'm miserable again. The light is there but I am so beaten its hardly enough. Any advice?

I know for fact, financially it would be easier for everyone in my family if I just died. I’m not sick or anything and my family does love me but I’m now just a burden. I dropped out of school because my friends told me to and I never liked working.
No matter how much I try getting my life back together, I just don’t have the motivation for it anymore after trying many times. I live in a small town now and it doesn’t give me any reason to keep trying. I lived in a big town with my aunt and uncle because they wanted to help me. We had many arguments and i fights because they told me I couldn’t have friends, I couldn’t have a boyfriend, I couldn’t hang with family and all that. It was a shitty deal I didn’t find out until after I moved down there.
I moved back to hometown because my mom didn’t want me having mental breakdowns down there anymore. No one understands and no one wants to help. I’ve tried many times but anyone who listens to me just thinks I’m just lazy or downright not trying.
I had insomnia for about a year now and it was only fixed when I lived in the big town. I found a guy I fell asleep and cuddled with at night and it helped for that majority but like I said, my aunt and uncle didn’t want me to have that so I got in massive trouble for it.

I’m currently feeling like shit, so I thought I’d come here to complain about my problems, but I decided not to. I hate complaining sometimes, as much as I do.
And this isn’t a criticism, but this subreddit is too negative, so I thought I should sprinkle a little hope and positivity.
Some background: I was officially diagnosed with depression at 10 years old, along with autism and anxiety. I consider myself a survivor of emotional and verbal abuse (though sometimes I doubt myself if it was actually abuse, but that’s what abused people do). I have struggled to make friends my entire life. It’s pretty safe to say I was not popular, which sucked because of my terribly low self esteem. I used to have suicidal thoughts at different points in my life, until recently. I had considered suicide multiple times in my life, although I never made any attempts. Also until recently, I had a nasty habit of aggressive self-deprecation. I am recently single from a relationship that I thought was \*the one\*, but upon having been dumped, I realised that I was mistreated, so I’m kinda grappling with heartbreak and coming to terms with the feelings that come with having, for a second time, allowed myself to be treated poorly in a relationship. I think it’s pretty safe to say, starting in my, probably early teen years, I have not been a happy person, not for long at least. I constantly suffer from a anhedonia, which is honestly torturous because it stops me from doing what I really enjoy doing.
Having kind of brushed over my life history with shitty feelings, now to the positivity.
I am exercising every night. It’s not much, but it’s something. I’ve taken up yoga (I hate it, it sucks, it’s painful, but apparently it helps with depression and anxiety, so I figured it’s worth a go. Point is, I‘ve set goals and I’m sticking to them.) I started a TAFE course (Australian thing) 6 weeks ago, and I love it (I did two years of university and they were some of the worst years of my life. TAFE is so much better for me.) It’s only two days a week, and I wish those days wouldn’t end.  I cleaned my bedroom a few weeks ago, and I have kept it clean. For the first time in three years, I am making friends. I would love to build up the confidence to ask them out for a casual drink, or anything outside of TAFE, but baby steps.   
Could things be better? Absolutely. As I’m writing this, I’m feeling shitty and lonely, and I just want someone to talk to. I’m still struggling with anhedonia, and  I want to enjoy myself again. But things are getting better. I finally have stuff to look forward to again.   
I was, and still am, sick of people saying “it gets better”, so I decided to make things better. I can’t make everything better, I wish I could, but I’m improving what I can control.
I know a lot of people who read this will be like ”I wish this would happen for me”, or “I wish I could make friends”, or “I can’t do this, or that“, etc. and I’m sorry. I wish this could be inspirational to someone, but I acknowledge the harsh, shitty reality of depression that things like that just don’t happen for some of us. But maybe, maybe the fact that I’m getting better will give someone, at least one person here hope that they too will get better.
I can’t promise things will get better for anyone, I especially can’t promise that to myself, but I sincerely hope, as someone who has battled with depression for over half their life, and will continue to do so for a long time to come, I desperately hope things do get better for all of you.",1

I have a vacation now and had planned to study for my exams this week. Monday I couldn’t help myself to. Tuesday and Wednesday I did about ~6 hours of studying each day because I was feeling very motivated and excited. I was feeling good those days too. Yesterday and today I’m feeling terrible. I want to study so badly but I can’t make myself to, even if I did, I’d be distracted with my depressive thoughts.

I’ve felt like shit for a long time, probably since I was 8, and got bullied from year 3 to year 12.
I have adhd as well so it makes it doubly worse because it’s just stacked executive dysfunction
I’m lost and I can’t actually visualise a future because I’m in a perpetual state of “well youre probably going to die soon anyway” and also that I just don’t WANT to do anything.
If I do want to do something I burn out or get sick of it really quick, and give up.
I can’t afford therapy anymore and even if I could I don’t know how to vocalise what I’m feeling even though we all feel and are going through an extremely similar thing.
When I went to therapy it was pretty useless. I know that it takes going to a few different people but both of the therapists I went to just didn’t understand what I was trying to explain and it was too exhausting.
I see a psychiatrist to get my ADHD medication (which really isn’t helping that much) and he’s a dumbass who said “people kill themselves wanting to look like you”
when I told him I was concerned about the weight I’ve lost since starting Vyvanse and how it’s affecting the rest of my life.
I’m 5’5” or 5’6” idk anymore and I haven’t weighed myself in literal years but I’ve never been over 53kg. Last time I got weighed (about 2.5 years ago) I remember being 49.5kg and I’ve only lost more weight since then.
I want to self harm (and have realised I do it by not eating and just using the additional lack of appetite due to vyvanse as the reason) by cutting or burning or hitting myself like I used to just to feel something
I’m just so exhausted and I take lamictal for anxiety which dampens all the emotions I feel so i can’t even do it because there’s no like ...... emotional push like there used to be (wrt adhd extremely reactivity). It just seems like too much effort for something that is gonna use energy and probably not feel like it used to
sometimes I do go “okay it’s a choice and I’m gonna get better and we’re gonna do what we need to do” and then I slip up on the tiniest thing, mostly bc of adhd, and i can’t keep the momentum going. Then it’s a cycle yadda yadda  you all know what I’m talking about

There are things in my life, like anyone else's, that are worth some anxiety and sadness but focusing on those things has become intrusive and my reactions to them magnified out of all perspective.
 I thought I had things under control the last few months but I've been sobbing at my desk off and on since 6 a.m. today. I did all day yesterday too.

I wish I could too but then I'd really be alone.
Crying at work is a problem, obviously, but I always hate going home even worse even though AND because there is nobody there (it makes no sense) and the loneliness is the worst part of my life at this point. It depletes the joy of everything in my life. Nothing seems to bring happiness or to be worth any effort when there isn't another human being in the world who knows or cares. TV, books, hobbies, music all seem useless and devoid of any meaning without the prospect of sharing with other people.

It was sad. on relationships, I was the type of guy that would go all in, I'd wear my heart on a sleeve, but I always get left out, I somehow develop anxiety for people coming into my life with so much meaning, into fear of losing those people. so for the next, I never treated somebody seriously. anyways on my last breakup, I somehow got tired of being too nice towards women, the phrase ""nice guys finish last"" always had an impact on me, so I changed my ways for 4 years it was somehow a goal of mine to be an asshole, since I figured it was the opposite of who I really was, and for 4 years I preyed on weak women and manipulated them (I'm not proud of those things), I play with their emotions and get inside of their heads most of the time, at this time of my life I swore that I will never go back to being in love. I despised love for making one's self vulnerable that someone might take advantage of your love for their own gain..........
But 3 months ago I met a woman that made me take look at what I've become,  We met in an unexpected way, she was different from all the women I've met ( well since mostly I toyed around weak women ) she was a breath of fresh air. She was strong, she is an artist, independent, interesting, she had a beautiful soul, she also has bipolar disorder. we hung out a lot and every day I had the opportunity to get to know who she really is,. in some ways, oddly enough our relationship got intimate enough where we only talk about life and our thoughts, there were times where she'd ask me to go to her flat and just so we could share the same bed, I respected this woman a lot, we never had sex but somehow the moments we've shared were more intimate than sex...

And I’ve read/heard this theme a lot but in conversation with my close friend, they just feel they don’t want to live anymore, it’s not the pain they’re escaping. 
They understand (I think) how I and their other close friends feel about them. My close friend’s other close friends are in the same country so they’re able to visit them, but for me it’s different.

Maybe they are fatigued by the fact that I never seem to get any better. Maybe they think I’m not putting in the work. I’ve been on ever changing medications for over a year now, and in therapy for Anxiety/OCD and Depression for going on 6 years. Are they drifting away because I’m not asking them for anything? What can I ask for to show them I care but not cause a burden to them? It just feels like a waste of their time, and I don’t want to lie to them anymore and say that their words make me feel better. But I also don’t want to hurt their feelings and lose them as friends.

test_pid_1221,I’m always ashamed : I can’t even pinpoint why or what exactly I’m ashamed of. Something about myself. Or maybe everything about myself? I’m always finding reasons why I suck.

I'm married and I know my husband loves me but for some reason it just doesn't feel like enough, like he's just with me because he couldn't find anyone else. 
I have no passion for anything anymore, even the things that I used to love. The only thing I'm looking forward to is finding out if I get to foster/possibly adopt my nieces' half sister, and my camping trip in April. I'm almost 30 and I don't have any kids because I can't get pregnant and it hurts so bad because all I've wanted since I was 16 was to be a mom. 
The only friends I have are at work or in a different state, and I haven't had a best friend in a long time. The last person I considered a best friend told everyone else how anxious and stupid I was. Any other friend I've had has always had a best friend and it's never been me. I always get passed up and come in second place, even with my family. I feel like I'm nothing.

test_pid_1226,"How the hell do I keep up with everything? : 
I fucked up today. I have a strict schedule so that I can get 
work, school, and everything else done. Even when I feel like shit and get hardly any sleep, I stick to this schedule because even going full steam ahead at it is only giving me micro steps towards a semblance of success. 
Last night, for some reason I fell asleep early. I remember asking myself what I had to do tomorrow and not being able to think of anything.  Then setting an alarm for early in the morning just in case I did have something. 
Well, predictably I slept in and missed something that I cant redo. It's put me really far behind on my schedule and I can only do it once a week (no specifics), and now my entire semester is going to be hellish trying to make up for lost time. 
How do people do it? How do they just follow routines like this every day? I made it 10 months without mistakes and now I fuck up once and it increases my stress and workload exponentially. 
The worst part is I want none of this. I dont want the path I'm going down. I just want to lay in bed all day until I muster up the nerve to kill myself. 
I'm far from the days where that was the reality, but this life isnt much better. I dont have any friends that I truly care about, and the ones that are around me are horrible influences. I'm too socially awkward (I embrace it because I dont know what else to do) to attract women for longer than they look at me.  I've failed my diet hundreds of times, though I stick to my exercise routine. 
I'm working towards something I dont want to be because I dont want to do anything! My depression is existential, which basically means everyone else patronizes me as some angsty teenager. But it also means I never wanted to do anything within reason. Sure I'd like to be a famous guitarist, but this is the real world and i dont have time for that when I'm supporting myself and getting an education. So I just chose what seemed like the least bad option - becoming a teacher. 
I hate math and am no good at it, i don't know how to nor want to know how to code so there goes those professions, I have a phobia of blood so no medical stuff, I couldnt work an office job, anything you name it I've researched it and had no interest. 
How am I supposed to keep pushing on if I can only pretend to be happy all the time, and then when I fuck up I instantly am a failure. 
I have NO ONE who believes I am depressed. My dad is like a backwoods hick type, evangelical christian who thinks science is the devil etc... I live with him because 35 hours a week at minimum wage cant pay for an apartment, a car, and school. But everyone shames me for living at home. 
Then if I got an apartment I wouldnt be able to afford the rest and people would call me a loser who isnt doing anything to improve himself. I cant win. 
For 2 years I cried everyday and now I cant even cry because the numbness is back. I'm constantly distracted in my classes and I only pass them because I'm highly intelligent when it comes to the humanities. My brain is all over the place, I have at least 3 anxiety attacks a day, sometimes while in class, it takes me 6 hours to write an essay because i cant focus. I get straight As but im not pushing myself and it's not enough because I'm deteriorating mentally this whole time. I feel like I'm going crazy sometimes and my physical tics are acting up as well. 
I thought if I worked hard I was supposed to build good habits that would stick. Surely nearly a year of hard work would fucking do something. But I feel even more lost than I was in my suicidal stages. And the worst part is that the world just doesn't care. Nobody cares that people like me are struggling, and they just see us as the weaker ones in the hierarchy and natural selection is weeding us out. 
It doesnt matter what desires I have to do good for the world because I'm not cut out for them. 
Just a week ago I thought I might have been doing better but now it all comes crashing down like this and it's out of my control.",1
test_pid_1227,"Obstacles to Therapy, every time : I'm 25, pretty sure I've had depression since I was a kid/teenager and have never seen a professional. And while I have not often reached out to do so, the few times I have, I've always encountered obstacles.
 As a teenager, my mom once became worried enough to find me a therapist...We met with them once (not a real session though), but they didnt take our insurance and my mom never continued the search. In college, I reached out to the university therapists and was always placed on a waitlist, where I would never hear back from them. Once they even stated that the waitlist was so long, I could choose to just be at the start of next semester's list, so I did. Next semester came and went, never heard back. As an adult, I tried to reach out once to someone, they were not taking new clients. Just tried again and apparently our insurance just issued us new cards, which nobody can seem to find...So I had to cancel my first appointment. 
And I know things like, someone not taking clients, or missing insurance cards are not huge obstacles. We will find/reorder the cards and I can try again. But with depression, even little obstacles can just be so demoralizing, and i know that even once i get in to see someone, we may not click. They may not be right for me, and i have to start all over again. It takes so much energy to even get started, and I'm already exhausted...",1
test_pid_1228,"Thank you to the woman at USPS : So one of the worst things about my depression is the horrible anxiety that comes along with it.

I walked up to the counter at my turn and handed the woman my custom’s form and she said, “you’re shaking! Are you okay” and I kind of just stuttered our that I had horrible anxiety. And it just clicked for her, and she was so kind and helpful. Encouraging me, and telling me not to worry about anyone else and that she’d help me with the whole process.

Every attempt I've made at putting myself out there has failed. My friends from highschool ditched me the day after graduation. No one in college wanted me around. The clubs I joined turned into a mockery of what I wanted so desperately to have. My life feels like a sick joke. When does it get better? I've been waiting so long. I've been paying for therapy I can barely afford for years now. And it's only gotten worse. I didn't think things could get worse when I've been struggling not to kill myself since I turned 13. It's been 20 years and I don't think it's going to change. And I'm honestly so terrified this is just what my life is. The kindest people in my life are strangers on the internet who forget about me so quickly.  I don't want to die. But I don't think I can keep this up anymore.

Got myself into severe debt. Lived off of a loaf bread for two weeks. Lost my dad. Mixed emotions because he sexually abused me. Had to help my sisters. Got a speeding ticket that suspended my license. Missed the hearing because I got a severe infection that almost made me septic and I was in the hospital. Had to appeal from missing my hearing. Had my electric almost shut off. Tried to apply for LIHEAP but they thought I was lying and I had a really scary investigator come to my house and ask my neighbors about me.

She leaves me to sit alone when she spots the cool kids walk in. Then they all laugh at me when she leaves me. I've stopped initiating conversations. Nobody listens, so why should I open my mouth? 
It feels like society hates you for being yourself. That's why I never talk. I'm afraid they'll laugh at me. 
What if I just want closure in real life, someone to hug? But there's nobody there. Nobody cares. Nobody knows, because if they knew, they'd hate me even more. 
And what if there's a boy in my class who sometimes follows me home or tries to walk inches behind me to creep me out? Every day I'm afraid of him. I'm so afraid he's going to hurt me in some way. I don't wear revealing clothing. I never expose more than my hands and my face. I hate my body so I hide everything I can. Why does he attack me?

test_pid_1267,"I won’t find a job before my body gives up. : For the past 9 months, I’ve been jobless and broke. Every day I’m searching for new opportunities, I even look for gigs, but I can’t afford a car to get anywhere due to the repetitive failure in searching for a new job. That’s only the beginning.
Because of failure after failure, I have nothing more than what’s saved in my bank account: Enough to finish my lease, but not enough to survive afterwards. 
I can’t spend any extra money outside of rent. In order to make sure all my bases are covered, I have 3oz of nuts and a glass of water as my daily meal. It may be food, but my digestive system, mental health, and weight have all deteriorated beyond what I thought was possible. I’m not sure where my body finds the waste to painfully get rid of, but it loves waking me up at least 10 times before I finally get up (I really don’t remember my last 4+ hour sleep). However, we’ll continue.
I haven’t had toilet paper, feminine hygiene products, and other bathroom essentials in a very long time. Those of you who have been where I am know the incredible discomfort of “making do” if you’re lucky and free-bleeding if you’re not. I got lucky at one point for about 3 months as I had little to no bleeding, but turns out that was malnutrition (which has only gotten worse but now I bleed very heavily as well). I never leave my room, but you can be certain during those weeks, I’m even more reclusive. I’ve gone as far as stealing toilet paper from the gas station bathrooms, but thats rare. I can’t bear knowing that this is what I’ve been reduced to in order to keep myself clean. We’ll keep going.
In 4 months, my lease is up. I’ve been trying everything I can to get out of it early ever since I moved in August last year, hoping that MAYBE someone will finally take over for me and I can move to a cheaper home, closer to more job options even if it means walking an hour to work every day. Not that’d I’d find a job. It’s almost been a full year since I’ve been THAT lucky. I’m certain if I don’t get out soon, I’ll be homeless by July. (A couch to crash on is 100% out of the question. My reclusiveness caused by a plethora of mental illnesses has made it nearly impossible to communicate with people in the real world, not that I really had “friends” before anyway.)
It’s not like it matters if I find a new job though. NOBODY pays me over $7.25/hr. Never in my life have I EVER seen more than that an hour, until it’s somebody else. Everybody else, even if they’re just as new as me, has always been started around $9 which still may not be enough to survive at this age, but it’s enough to keep them fed and sane until next paycheck. Not me. Never. I wish there was a better explanation but maybe I need to stop mentioning race, gender, and that I have a disability. Maybe that’s why nobody will take me. I’m everything an employer DOESNT want because it makes me seem too slow or too stupid to do my job properly. If anything, I have an eagerness to work that my peers don’t, and it’s likely a product of absolute desperation to prevent my body from completely giving out on me, landing me in the hospital where I’ll lose everything I own and end up gone the moment I check out.
I never would’ve expected such a bright eyed, friendly, little-girl to have turned out so fucked up and ruined, beat down from mental and sexual abuse, bullying, and the occasional physical abuse.",1

But I just can't, I am totally numb when people are around me and don't have anything to do or say except being kind, I guess. I can't build strong relationships, I don't hate people but I just can't. Sometimes things happen, like someone says something I don't like, or I fail a small task, and I get totally blue and just need to go home and be alone. It's not about being suicidal, or lonely, it's just that I can't feel anything. I think that people usually consider me a nice person and wouldn't mind having me hanging out with them, anyways I'm not close friend to anyone anymore and no one really likes or needs me. All my original friends strengthen their friendships every day, they do things together, they have things to talk and joke about while I get farther as time passes. I'm fairly attractive, but I can't get a girlfriend, because I have no character and never know what to say to be cool, fun, smart, or whatever. I always have been an introvert and struggled to 'emerge' in social contexts because I feel my personality is so damn weak, but when I was younger I could have friends, enjoyed going out with them, having girlfriends.

I want to believe people need me here. That killing myself because there's no point isn't a reason, and everyone here would miss me and they love me. I think those are excuses.

I really wish I did not exist. I have been alone through primary, secondary, sixth form. I can not easily describe how much I hate people. People are born amoral bordering on evil. One of my earliest memories is of an incident in primary school that has taught me this. It was break time, a summer afternoon, and being in a rural area there was an abundance of insects. A cockchafer, an insect you may recognise by its iridescent wing case, had landed and I was watching it crawl over the grass. A few other children came over. I heard them talking and that they had decided to kill it. I positioned my body over the bug, and they kicked me. Several of them, repeatedly. I do not remember what happened to the insect.

I can't even go to meetups when someone calls

test_pid_1304,what I’m realizing about depression : I’m realizing you can only fall into depression if you focus on it. If you could just find something positive to do to distract you from your depression you will soon realize it was all a mindset. I’m finally realizing your life is what you make it and how ever you view yourself that’s what you will become. And even the negative things life throws at us doesn’t matter if we don’t give it our attention. Take control of your life brothers I feel like a new person right now. I’m not saying it’s gonna be easy but I feel like with enough practice you can train your mind into thinking from this perspective. It’s like distracting your mind for the better.,1

All of the work I do seems so pointless because in the end I’ll still be a miserable and hopeless. Is this really what life is? Just a test to see if you can go on another day? I feel so disconnected from everything and I don’t even care anymore. I don’t care about work, money, socializing, goals, etc. I mean, why do something if you gain nothing worthwhile from it? That’s why I believe working hard is bullshit. Life should be always peaceful and happy with no pain but unfortunately the world isn’t designed this way so we’re fucked.

I am not sure whether i belong in this community, with my problems but im going to type away because i dont have anywhere else to vent. its honestly a mess. you wouldnt understand what im about to say either, but here goes.
i promised myself after exams were over, id treat myself to a great life in the next 5 months of holidays. but absolutely none of that have been great for me. i planned on playing alot of games, getting alot of money in my first job, spending time with my friends, being generally fucking happy. but right now, i feel like im stuck in a limbo of feelings. am i actually sad?depressed?confused?unsure?or maybe im mixing all of this up for just momentary sadness. i dont know.i cant read my feelings anymore. im numb?.sorry. ill try to stick to the topic. i have too many reasons for feeling this way-too many to comprehend, but ill dive into some i guess.
i didnt get to do any of what i wanted to do. my parents lied to me. they promised that after exams, all im allowed to do is game like shit. unlimited play time. for me, playing games is freeflow dopamine. unfortunately, i didnt get to play much, often i got into arguments with parents when they didnt allow me to play. it felt like i was betrayed. i believed in a lie for months, now ive been slapped in the face. i even worked for 2 months like my father wanted me to when he made those promises again and again up till my exams in november. now is february, and playing hasnt been easy. its come to a point that when i do actually get a chance to play, its not as thrilling as before. the kick isnt there. that hurts. its my go-to, but now even when i can go to it, i dont really want to. 
i think thats all i can pull out of my brain with that.. on to the next one.
i have a problematic addiction to masturbation. i hate to admit to it. its not as bad as most, though. the problem with it is that my religion is heavily against it and everytime i do it, i just cant look at my family and friends the same way, i feel ashamed to be who i am because of what ive done. maybe im exaggerating.but my thoughts have escalated to wanting to have sex with someone. not forcefully-like raping, no. all this is messing with my head so bad. i know hormones are kind of the culprit, since im 16 going 17.
i have a money problem. work has caused a shit ton of stress on me mentally and emotionally. i broke down at work a couple times too. so, when i come to find out that i very well dont hve the money i should have earned, i feel betrayed. but i guess this just sounds like another case of a teenager getting a bite of adulthood.but seriously, it sucks so bad to see my money deplete when the most i spent on was food. not even the extravagant ones. 
work itself is a problem. the environment is toxic for me, and me working alone mentslly hurts me as i always have to deal with large workloads alone and it causes alot of stress. to top it off, i cant work there as it hurts my exceema on my body. but finding another job has been near impossible. either the jobs affect my health, or they require a certain time i need to commit too that i cant. however, i havent ask a certain retail outlet because im in fear. in fear of new enviornments and new people.
my parents probably see me as a disappointment. my mom and dad have been angrily shouting and scolding and nagging at me to study hard after months of not doing so (a whole nother story of its own) to score a decent grade.  but i finally managed to and result came out in january. and i went from multiple C's and E's to 2 As, 4Bs and 1C. however, my parents didnt show me the same energy they did when they were scolding and nagging to my more or less good score. they didnt care. they treat me like im still lazy. but a lazy person wouldnt have scored that. i worked hard. i was honestly disappointed with my result. i was dealing with difficult problems that year, my grandma passed and studying was something i could do easily. so i felt that i should have been appreciated more. but i wasnt. it hurts to feel betrayed this way. i feel fucking worthless because of it too. moving on, my dad has always wanted me to grow up to be a basketball player, a skillful one who made it to the nba. but not once in my life have i shown any intrrest in it or skill too. so i think thats why hes never really loved me properly - because im a disappointment. he didnt care about my results lol, he just wanted me to do what he wants. and it just continuously fucks my head up because i feel that he just wants someone to live his dream but i cant cuz im fucking shitty at this and i hatw him at the same time but when i stop to think about him on his deathbed, how will he feel about me? the tim he commited to me, just for me to turn out into sonething far from what he wanted. i dont want hin to feel unloved or sad. but thats what he is doing to me. what the fuck do i do?i dont know anymore
i hate living. its complex. life is full of lies. the best people leave you, and no one loves you. i had two best FUCKING friends. they knew me more than my parents. but one day, they just left. left me alone. i was shattered. now i have no one to talk to, and my thoughts are constantly confused and problematic and dieing feels much easier. i dont kmow if im mentally ill or just exaggersting i dont know if my opinion matters since im just some 16 year old i dont. fucking know. i say i mastirbate and want to have sex but thats probably because i lack love and affection and happoness so if i start a relationship its probably because of those reasons but relationships are a waste of time. people will just leave you one day. alone. fuck man. fuck. im so fucked up. i dont even know rn,as im typing this, whether what all i just said was valid. or am i exaggerating. or am i just a coward. or am i just a fat fucking loser. fuck me. i hate myself. fuck me.
there you have it. youve reached the end. i know you cant make sense of any of this . its ok. me too. im glad i could write a fragment of it down. im hoping its accurate. i commonly feel different about some things. idk why.

test_pid_1318,"I just want to die because I’m weak and my sisters don’t care that I’m depressed. : How do I stop getting depressed about what people say to me? 
I tend to become sad quickly, because I think everyone has bad intentions. I hate how I let words get to me, how easily I can go from happy to sad because of a few words that don’t matter to the person who said them. I feel too sensitive and weak to live. People say things without really caring about what impact it can have and I just can’t handle that. I have social anxiety so being around people is just a pain in general.
(if you don’t want to read the examples then please just answer how I can stop being so sensitive)
Example one- My sister has a friend who’s having issues with an abusive boyfriend. I’ve never met her. This happened a few days ago. Her friend was supposed to come over, but my sister didn’t hear back from her. She said she met be dead because she knows that she had those thoughts before. I told her to call her because I was worried. She said no I have my own life to worry about. That really broke me. I was shocked because I thought what about me? Your sister with depression. I felt like it meant that it doesn’t matter if I died. I know she’s probably the person who would care the most, but I’m so hurt. Please don’t think sister is a bad person. She’s going through a lot of stress right now and she checked up on her friend.
Example 2- My other sister has her own life and mental health issues, therefore feel like she’s taking her anger out on me. I know she isn’t the best with depressed people because she’s insensitive with the feelings of others. I tried to call her out on her behavior last weekend, but insisted that it never happened. At the end she said I’ll just stop talking to you then. I believe she said that last week too. This morning it’s like it never happened, but I still remember.
Last week she said it’s lame how my only friends are my siblings. I just can’t get close to people.",1

test_pid_1324,"Should I kill myself because of interracial dating? : Pretty much I wanna kill myself  because I am severely depressed and suicidal due to Racist reasons, I  guess you could say. I literally wanna die whenever I see a white  girl/""man of color"" couple, usually the guy is black. I'm not sure why  it affects me so much but it does. I feel horrible, inadequate, inferior  and depressed.
If I see one these  couples I literally wanna die I just can't take it. I guess I also  wanna die at the fact that like immigrant dudes from like the Middle  East just come to the Western World and screw a bunch of hot white  chicks from here. It makes me wanna die. \*This is the main reason I am  suicidal\*
I've attempted suicide  twice. I feel like the World is ending, for at least white people.  Because I've been to London and France (near Paris), both places were  literally like 8/10 people on the street were either black or Muslim -  and I know that being racist is horrible but like it literally just  looks like these people took over those countries.
Here  in America, Latinos and stuff have taken over completely, and Asians  too... but I don't mind as such because America belongs to no one so I'm  not really upset by this. Canada also has huge Muslim populations...  and it just seems like (a) white people are dying off and being replaced  and (b) Christianity is dying and being replaced with Islam in this  part of the World.
And for someone  like me, a white Christian... well, this isn't good. I have absolutely  no will to live. I don't see a future for me here. I wish I didn't care  but I just do. And it just depresses me all day everyday.
I'm  probably gonna get heavily attacked after what I just said. I deserve  it. Well, if I offended you, please assure yourself that I'll probably  be killing myself very soon, so you can all be happy knowing that. 
P.S I'd also like to mention one of  my parents is Latino, so I have heard Spanish in my family my whole  life. I still consider myself white though. I also had a Muslim friend  who was my best friend for around 5 years, and I was also best friends  with a black guy for around three years. I've also seen my parent that  is Latino be racially abused and got very upset as a result, and I  supported them. I'm also third generation American.
I didn't even used to feel like this, It started a few years ago though. I wish I wasn't like this. But nowadays in America the amount of white girls who go for black guys is absolutely insane. It’s 100% noticeable and is a phenomenon. There’s no way it isn’t true the sheer amount of these couples is crazy. There no escape for me. I feel like suicide is my only option.

test_pid_1326,"Been feeling this way for sometime : I just felt like letting it out.
I have been thinking for sometime, if it is me to blame, it's like I want to do animating. Or the work doesn't matter, but it's not the first thing I started out suddenly, but just what I could easily do without support. So, I have always been serious about anything I try doing, or so I think. I love piano, I wish, I could get one. And, I love art, digital art. My interest in piano has been there for long time, but there were other things keeping it buried, and art, traditional art I kind of felt uncomfortable with, uneasy. It makes me uncomfortable and is tiring to get clothes dirty. And then is a bit stressing in general, for me. So, since I discovered digital art few years ago, I really wanted to do it. I did get into it, I tried a lot, but I only had computer with mouse. I did keep at it for sometime, but it was really tiring and not satisfying, and everywhere I found that graphics tablets, even the cheapest ones can do wonders. So, I wanted one...
And I personally believe, that talent doesn't come naturally, but is ones desires and interests in art or whatever, that's what makes one good at something. Because, interest is what makes you want to get into something, to practice it, to get good at it. I wanted that out of way before continuing.
... So, I asked for it, though I didn't get to hear anything like, I can't draw or be artist or something like that. I did get asked for what? where it was possible at that time, my mother didn't know what it is for, I don't think it was only that. Even after finding out about it, I got to hear things like, can it really help? have I tried without it? why do I need it? and behind those questions was my experience over year or so. And to me it seemed like, deep down there might have been a question, if I can even do it. Or, that art is not worth as it's not paying. It was just how I felt, from what I had heard from such conversations before. It wasn't really purely intuition based mind reading or prediction. Well, in the end I had to give it up.
Then there was interest in piano I had, it is very similar case with this, I asked for piano and it was seen as why do I want one? have I tried other ways? what about using computer keyboard? and yes piano too, I did try playing in whatever way I could find. I didn't ask for it based on nothing. Then, I searched up beginner piano and came up with low price, but good enough quality, keeping check of price. I can tell, if something might be too cheap or too expensive, and my choice was based on what's most affordable, not only in general but for my family too. But, my father looking at it found it to be professional level, somehow. I don't want to blame anyone for anything, tbh. It just hurt me a lot. And yeah, like that I couldn't do that either.
Then, recently I tried getting into animation. This, I found to be easy enough, I don't know if it's only for me or what. But, it's something, I could even go as far as to make $3 in 2 weeks, since I started. It's kind of encouraging, but because of how it went and is, also discouraging. I don't have my own PC, so, I only get like 9 hours at most in a day, if I wake up super early, like 6 in morning. But, yeah with this I want to be able to do freelancing, and for that I will need my own PC to be able to manage it throughout the day, as it's restricting to not be able to do anything other than some set time each day. And feels insecure. But, with getting my own PC too, I seem to have pretty much no support, it is what is currently happening. And, then when I'm asked to tell details and all, I honestly start doubting even myself. I feel, that I want to be trusted a little. Because, I myself am unable to trust myself and tell if I will really be able to do as I say.
It's kind of what has been happening over the years.
I don't know if I'm just making excuses, but I have been insecure and lonely. So, I need a little more trust and not be asked too many questions for everything. It's not like, I have ever been given much chance to try anything, I have liked, I have had interest in. So, I might never know, and unless I am trusted and supported no one will else will know either.
Sorry, it's super long. I kind of wanted to hear, what different people thinks about this. Or, maybe, like my most posts. It will get buried under other posts.
Unnoticed. 😔

test_pid_1336,"What is the point? : I don’t mind if no one reads this as I just need to get it off my chest.
What is the point of it all? People tell you not to kill yourself but they have no clue the pain you go through everyday. 
I’m a 22 year old male who had to drop out of college, quit work, and give up everything I love at the age of 19 due to a mysterious sickness that runs rampant and controls every bit of my life. It wasn’t until recently that I was diagnosed with a mycotoxin illness (something that is very difficult to treat)I believe I have many other undiagnosed illnesses as well. My mitochondria has been hugely affected by this illness, and I wake up everyday with extreme joint aches , muscle pain, brain fog, and just straight up confusion. I didn’t realize how much I had taken for granted until I got sick, how great my memory used to be, and how good my skin, and body used to feel. The fact that I used to complain about being tired baffles me, as now I have reached a new level of tiredness. I’ve lost 50 pounds , my hair has thinned and some of it has even fallen out. I’ve had dark rings under my eyes for the past three years due to extreme insomnia and being so uncomfortably skinny to the point where my bones ache on my mattress. I take around 130 something supplements a day and eat incredibly healthy but feel that nothing has helped with my sickness. I feel like i’m dying, but my body just simply wont die. I was professionally told not to exercise as it would only deplete my mitochondria even further , but it’s been too many years of hopelessness that I have begun to exercise again (which feels impossible but I push through) 
It’s very difficult for me to socialize with this sickness as it affects my brain and has caused me great anxiety in mostly all social situations , but I have become better at controlling my anxiety. I have basically lost all my friends, but truthfully when you hit rock bottom you realize there is no such thing as true friends as everyone unfortunately stops caring after a while. It still hurts me. The worst part is your family stops caring, and they give up on you. 
Before I became ill I was the fittest I had ever been , and I was doing well in school and life. I had a beautiful girlfriend, I was surfing everyday and just really enjoying life. I had worked many overtime shifts at a pizza delivery place through the years and had managed to save up $30k , which was something I was genuinely really proud of . My goal was to create a better life not only for me one day, but for my family. That’s why it breaks me even more to see my parents age while I lay here disabled in ailment .  The worst part is no one truly understands, that’s why I’ve lost friends and my relationships have crumbled. The first few years hurt the most when it came to broken relationships, but I became stronger and saw it more of a blessing as most of my friends were never really the ambitious types to begin with . I feel like a bird in a cage, I feel completely stuck and I’ve felt this way consistently for three years. There have been many times where I want to end it all, but I’m too afraid too scared to see what lies ahead. 
I’m completely aware that there are many unfortunate people just like me, many even far more unfortunate. But to me that’s all relative, it doesn’t make my situation any better. I feel so belittled by society, I feel so broken and destroyed that it’s overwhelmingly  difficult for me to get up out of bed in the morning and tackle my daily tasks. It’s even difficult for me to type this out right now as my brain is simply on fire. 
Somedays I feel like i’m becoming healthier so I become happier and live a little more, and then the next day I’ll wake up and i’ll be back on square one... sick and mentally drained. This inconsistency is what drives me insane. It’s like i’m constantly getting a whiff of life but never really getting to taste it and enjoy it.
My physical symptoms have created many mental symptoms. I’m very mentally ill, I have no one to talk to , and that makes me feel so very alone.",1
test_pid_1337,"How can I explain to my fiancé that I can’t choose when I feel depressed? : Title. I consider myself incredibly lucky to have met someone that I love as much as they love me, but I’m finding it increasingly difficult to communicate when I’m feeling low, and what I need to come out of it.
The best I can come up with is that “it will pass, like it always does” - but therein lies another issue; I never know for sure if it will.
I feel like I’m lying to my partner daily to keep them from worrying, but as a result they don’t understand when I’m depressed and when I’m not.
On days when we’ll have plans, or lack thereof, and depression hits me hard, I can’t muster the courage to explain it for fear they’ll assume I’m faking it to get out of doing something.
I feel like I’m in a rut, while they’re just absolutely not. I’m afraid of weighing them down, and in all honesty I’m growing mildly resentful that they don’t understand what I’m feeling...
I’m angry that I can’t enjoy the things that used to make me happy, and I’m deathly terrified of taking it out on someone I love in a fit of desperation.

test_pid_1340,"I want to turn my life around : For most of my 19 years living in planet Earth, I felt that I have always been stumbling around aimlessly. There were many times I felt that the rest of my life will remain that way; and honestly I would be filled with misery and hopelessness every time I thought of it. Fortunately I was blessed with a few good brothers and sisters and a caring family. Although I was near insanity, I managed to hold on and endure. I know that my life sounds sad and depressing but I do have many happy memories, most of them spent with family and friends. If it wasn't for them all I wouldn't be able to come to my current realization.  
​  
It all started when I discovered anime, manga, and nooks. I've kept it a secret from pretty much everyone that I love to watch anime, read manga, and novels. I kept it secret because I knew I'd get slammed if I ever get exposed. Especially during elementary and middle school. The schools I attended had a decent plague of delinquency and I witnessed and participated in pretty harsh stuff. Looking back at it now, that was probably what made me start losing my vision for my future. Many people, including me, were so obsessed with their reputation, social image, and such that they were willing to step on others just to raise their own standing. Of course I did some despicable stuff too mostly because I wanted to ""fit in"". Especially as a Filipino immigrant, I was kind of desperate to make friends and so before I knew it...I was doing dumb idiotic things with dumb idiotic wannabe-gangsters.  
​It wasn't during high school that I started to open up and change the way I acted. My family and I move to a better town and it felt like a fresh start. That was where I met some decent friends, and everything seemed to be a bit easier not worrying about too many things. Well high school was actually pretty horrible. All the dumb drama that I was pulled into. I dreaded going to school, all I cared about was playing and having ""fun"" with friends and so I deliberately let my grades fall to a shameful level. Things go on and I eventually graduate, and that was when sh\*t started spiraling towards the abyss.  
​As a Filipino with Filipino Parents, it was expected of you to work in the medical field. I didn't really care since I didn't know what else to do so I accepted and applied for courses for Nursing at a local college. Unfortunately I haven't gotten rid of my habits from high school. The semester ended and I had horrible grades, thus failing to meet my parent's expectations. My parents and I argued for what seemed like ages. What made it worse for me is that I knew that I was in the wrong but that only pissed me off even more; I always ended the arguments by spouting BS and running away. I isolated myself from everyone, I would barely come out of my room. A year passed just like that and I ended another semester with horrible grades. At this point I was at my lowest. I was just so tired of everything. Tired of the world, tired of society, tired of my family's expectations, tired of everyone, and I was especially tired of myself. I spent most days staring into space as I regret everything that I had done; Wishing for a chance to redo my life, wishing for someone to come save me, I wished for all of it to end.  
​I'm not sure when it started but I eventually changed. It was like someone flicked a switch and all of the sudden I started moving again. All I can seem to recall is that I read something very tragic from book; and right after that my mind just straight up exploded. Like an old machine suddenly starting up again. The rusty gears started moving as the puzzle pieces came together in my mind. I had a realization... This whole time I was so focused on hating myself and  regretting my decisions that I had completely neglected my surroundings. I thought of my three younger sisters going through the same thing I did at school; My mom who cared for the whole family even though we always stress her out; My dad who was the only one working to support a family of six yet still has the energy to work on his other projects; My two older sisters worrying about their own families; My best friends who have their own fair share of troubles... All of it just shot into my brain.  
​My family looked fine from the outside but in truth, we sure were a fine mess. After my realization I had decided that I needed to just let it all out. The next day I told my family that we needed to have a family meeting. The meeting quickly turned into a bawling session as we talked about our regrets and thoughts on everyone's current situation. After we calmed down, we managed to talk about the future and what must be done. We talked about how my sisters should keep their grades up in preparation for college. We talked about how I needed to keep on going to school get my degree so I can get working. We talked about many more things before having to go to sleep as everyone had obligations tomorrow. The world suddenly looked a little brighter to me as I now had a goal in life. Although I still wasn't sure if Nursing is what I truly wanted to do, but I still smiled and walked forward because my family and I were finally united in something.  
​**Epilogue(?):**  
​Months pass and things are going fine. I'm still watching anime, and reading books and manga. I've also recently gotten into cooking and have been making meals for the family. I'm still doing courses as I continue to think about my future. Almost a week ago my dad came home from work and gave me a book he got at a book signing event. He told me about when he wrote a book about himself. BOOM my brain explodes as I have come to another realization... My drawing is horrible and I don't even know how to animate but... how about I write a book? ​BOOM my brain overclocks as I search for somewhere to write and share my novel. I find one (webnovel.com) and quickly got to work, I had never had been so... so happy doing something. I had so much fun writing and I was so eager to continue. I finally found something to be passionate for and I thought this is it... this is the one! My parents have always said that they want the best for me and they will support and love my sibling and I no matter what; they've done so much for us yet I still ended up disappointing them. I want to prove that they can be proud of me. I want to write not only for my family but especially for myself. I want to climb out of the hole I dug myself into.

test_pid_1341,"Can't stop thinking about the past - please help : Hello.
I am writing here because I think that I need some help.
Sorry if my english skills are not the best, but that's not my native language.
Basically, my problem is that I can't stop thinking about the bad things I have done in the past
and that I always need to talk with someone about it, then I can rest for a few days before I start thinking about it again...
The thoughts are mostly about scams in the internet, because when I was 11 years old I scammed someone for few dollars, and I did it again few more times.
Almost everytime it was some low amount, not higher than 5 dollars. The only one time it was \~50 dollars, it was a skin for a video game.
I feel very, very bad after doing each of these, and I always felt ""I need to give it back"" in myself.
I did what I could, but there are few situations where it was really hard and I couldn't always give 100% back, but most of the time I did.
What hurts me the most, for now, is that there is a forum on the internet where I had my account registered when I was teenager,
and it can be connected to my real identity. There are some ""cringe"" posts as well, I don't want anyone to find them.
The forum is related in some way to one scam I did, for let's say, 2 dollars.
I can't delete it as the account is banned. But my mind always goes there (as I know how to search for it) to think about the scams and I can't stop thinking about it.
I have even feel suicidial, because of that.
Also, there is something inside me that makes me tell everything bad I do to my parents. I don't know why.
I don't want to tell them about everything so I have some secrets, but it hurts me. I am also scared of their
reaction sometimes - so that's why I can't tell them everything, but they know about few. Their reaction wasn't bad almost all the time, but still,
I don't want to tell them everything...
What I need is to stop thinking about it. Stop thinking even if there is some smallest ""evidence"" that I did something bad (the forum I mentioned).
Please help me with that. I will read every of your reply and try it. I will probably delete this post, please I beg you to not archive it.
I can't really start to ""live life"", because I always think about the past. I could do so many awesome things, but instead I am wasting my time everyday.
PLEASE, help me.
Thank you all.",1

test_pid_1348,"Outed by my friend : My friend and I are both teenage males. A while back, he started streaming his gaming for fun because he enjoys talking to people. However, he started out very unconfident in himself. Since I enjoy his personality, I would always tell him how fun his streams are. Not to tell him what he wants to hear, but because he seemed to need the confidence boost and I really did feel his streams were exceptional. He put a ton of effort into them.
This went on for a long time. I'd always watch his streams, give him good feedback, help with ideas, give him money to get more games. I wanted to support him because I love him as a friend and know how important his streams are to him.
Leaving that for a moment, but it will be important later. One night recently, he was telling me about some of his personal issues. He never opened up to anyone about his mental problems. I comforted and told him I'd always love him and I'll help him through his problems. I'd help him get the professional help he needs. I went to his counsellor meeting with him, and his doctor appointment because he was nervous to go alone. He still has problems obviously but he is on the right track to helping himself.
A couple nights ago, I thought I'd tell him about my own mental issues. I suffer from a severe mental condition, and because of the stigmas, I have never told anyone. He got extremely mad at me. He started saying how he hated me because I was always fake. Whenever I told him his streams were good, he felt I was insincere. He thought I was being fake by helping him with his issues. He then said that people need to see the monster that I am. He screenshotted the messages where I talk about my issue and sent them to our whole friend group. I guess he was trying to warn them of the person I was.  (and I'll stress that it's not an issue that would make anyone fear me.)
I'm sitting here stunned.  I was honest with him the entire time. I was never insincere with my support but he's so determined that I was. I think people are allowed to have secrets and I'm angry that he told everyone mine when I never told anyone about his problems. I'm also angry that my kindness was taken for granted.  I don't want anything in return for what I did.  But getting hated for what I did?  Being made out to look like a bad person?  It's very hurtful considering the time and effort I put towards him.

test_pid_1362,"Can't stop thinking about the past - looking for help and advices : Hello everyone,
I am looking for help, regarding my problem, which is that I can’t stop thinking about the bad things I’ve done in the past. I’ve posted here once today already, but I deleted is as I needed to rethink what I’ve written. Here’s the new version. (Sorry for my English – not native speaker).
I can’t stop thinking about the bad things I’ve done in the past. What it includes is mostly internet scams. I was teenager then (it started at age 12) and I’ve scammed multiple people for \~5 dollars in average. Sometimes it was less, sometimes it was more.
It seems like it’s not a big amount but – for me it is. After every of these scams I felt “I need to give it back”, so I did. Where it was possible, after some time I decided to give it back and say sorry, but it was not always possible – that’s what hurts me. The biggest “scam” was  a video game skin, for like 70 dollars. I gave back as much as I could then, but never could say sorry. I think I might be able to do this in the future – then I will do it. I think I did it because I got scammed few time myself as a kid too, so it was some kind of “revenge” maybe.
For the “source” of this problem I can see an internet forum (as for now? who knows what my mind will suggest me later.) where I registered as a teenager. I scammed someone for like 2 dollars here and let’s say the forum account is in some way linked to my real identity – and I can’t delete it as it is banned. I tried talking to the administrator but no way. As I know how to search for it, my mind goes there very often. I wish it could get deleted, but it won’t.
The forum account also has some low quality posts, as I was a teenager then and I didn’t think about it.
I think I am in some way scared, paranoid that someone can “dox” me in the future and find these posts. They do not include anything really, really bad, and no real evidence of the scam itself there. I am just being paranoid. I don’t know how to stop it. Maybe I am scared about someone “doxing” my past too?
Also, there’s a thing in “me”, that tells me to say about everything I’ve done bad in the past to my parents. I told them about some of the bad things, but I also want to keep some secrets. I don’t want to make them sad or be angry at me. I think it happens because they always considered me a good person, and they don’t know about the bad things I’ve done. It looks like I am trying to change their mind in some way, by telling them these things, but that’s not my intention. I am a good person and I know it. I didn’t scam anyone for a few years now and I consider myself as a good person. I wouldn’t scam anyone ever again, even if someone would give me access to his bank account or something where I could take his money anonymously – I wouldn’t. I am serious about it. I just feel like I need to tell them about it.  
I’ve talked about it with my closest friends, and most of them know what I did in the past and they say that everyone did something dumb, and I should look on the past as some lesson. But I just can’t forget about. I am also scared that someone who knows me in real life will find the forum  or something and make fun of me. I don’t know why. I know the threat isn’t real. I just don’t know how to fight it. My friends have seen the forum and said there's  nothing important in there and the posts are pretty good as for XX years old (don't want to put the age there) and that others in meanwhile were playing games (wasting time) while I decided to do something.
I think that I could do really amazing things if I could just stop wasting time thinking about it.
What really could help me is getting my past erased some way. I would really want to be born again and not do the same mistakes. I am good person for now (I know it) but if other people find my past (and that’s possible) then my mind thinks it’s over for me.
(+) When I was writing this post I feel really good. I don’t know how to describe it. It’s like going to church to tell about your sins. I feel clear. But also, in the same time I feel there’s something “bad”, idk, like I am not clear fully, but in 90%.
Please help me do something about it, any advice is really appreciated and I will try it.
Thank you.",1

One “friend” said, paraphrasing here, isn’t depression for teenagers, isn’t she a little old for that, what’s wrong with her. I felt so ashamed. I sat there and said nothing.

test_pid_1365,"i’m so troubled and misunderstood : this has taken me a while to write but these past 2 years have been horrible and only have gotten worse. i’ve told my mom and my brothers how i feel but of course they don’t understand or care enough to try to understand. the other day my brother came over to tell me how big of a failure i am and that i’m a bum and i’ll be nothing in life. this was all said because i’m 17 and i dropped out and don’t have a job due to not having my license and no car. and i’m not a fucking bum, i just have a “bum” lifestyle. smoking weed, getting drunk, taking adderal , hydros , vaping. whatever. bum things sure. i’m just surrounded by it all. my mom doesn’t give a fuck and my step dad is an idiot who lets his kids do the same thing. and i do them because why not, it’s being handed to me and i have nothing better to do besides laying in bed watching netflix or on my laptop. my mom tells me “oh my god you do nothing all day but lay in bed and do nothing “ but i dropped out due to depression and body dysmorphia, wanting to do homeschooling but of course my mom won’t go to the school and unenroll me. she’s also the reason why i don’t have a license. i didn’t drop out to do all that shit ^ wtf and that’s what my family doesn’t understand. i want to do so many things, i want to graduate, i want to get a job. depression is a bitch and it doesn’t help when my whole family doesn’t understand and put me down all the time but they know i cut myself and i’ve told them straight up i rather be dead and want to kill myself. it also sucks being so poor. my mom probably doesn’t have over 100 dollars rn. no bank accounts or anything. so i understand why i’m not getting the help i need or getting the homeschooling started. my life just fucking sucks. i don’t know what to do, i don’t know what they want me to do. i should go to school but i’d do a lot better in homeschooling because in school, i’m constantly thinking about how i look, going to the mirrors to look at myself and cannot focus on my work or in class because add, and the repulsive thoughts that comes with depression and bdd. i just think killing myself would prove my whole family that i’m not fucking playing but if i killed myself, i break down knowing that i’d die never accomplishing all these things i want to do and that i’d die without ever feeling peace with myself and real happiness. it really hits hard but maybe they would finally understand and just be like “oh shit she wasn’t lying “ but it would also kill them. besides them treating me like shit, they love me sure. no sympathy or respect or support but i know if i killed myself it would break them. i don’t think “if i was dead no one would care “ duh they’ll fucking lose their shit but well, i think they deserve to live with realizing they didn’t do shit to help me and live with knowing they made it worse. this post is a mess but i don’t know how to say it in any other way. this is the end sure of this post. advice? i’ve sat down with them and explained everything but welp, they still dgaf and won’t give me shit for a little but go back to calling me a lowlife nobody , bum, failure , lazy or if they do “listen” they’re like “well blake you don’t even try” . said this before , im not depressed because i don’t do anything  , i don’t do anything because i’m depressed. and i do fucking try. i take care of myself, as much as i hate myself , i’m talkative. i openly talk about how i feel . i just can’t do much. i think getting a job will help but i’d have to take the bus which i’m meh with. i have anxiety over specific things but i’m down to try things. not afraid to try new things out so please let me know anything you might think will help this situation. i think once i get in my homeschooling, therapy or some shit. and getting a job would also show my family that i’m not a weak scared pathetic lil bitch like they think i am. but again poor as hell so. alright i’m done. drops mic. this is messy but y’all get it ig",1

I had been pretty content lately. I quit my full time job a few months ago and have dedicated myself to helping my son along with his therapists (he has a speech delay). I am able to more efficiently take care of the home, the errands, cleaning and cooking, and everything else. My partner just goes to work and comes home. He doesn’t help much at all, except maybe loading the dishwasher at night. I work part time in the evening now as we need the money.
I have let go of many hopes and dreams. I was studying my BS in Web Development and I had a 4.0 while working full time and being Super Mom but for economic reasons, I had to quit studying.
I’ve been living with my partner for over 7 years now and I know we’re never going to get married. I let go of that dream too.
I let go of being able to be financially independent because my son needed me more. My partner hasn’t been the best to me (and in turn, I’ve retaliated) and our sex life and intimacy are dead which is something he argues a lot about. He gets angry but will not put in the effort to make me feel loved and appreciated. 
Now my partner has noticed lately that I was happy and even made some off handed comments with some oddly displeased faces like “Why are *you* so happy?.”
But the other day, he started telling me I was sad and wasting myself because I didn’t want more. I told him I have all I can have for now and when my son is in school I’ll be able to do more but that I was happy. He told me I needed to want more because he wasn’t happy with this life. He wanted more money. 
I told him that we’re in our mid thirties and at this point, it is incredibly hard to make the kind of money he wishes he had. He got angry and we started yelling at each other. I kept saying I was happy but if he wasn’t, he could always do something about it. Build the business he always talked about, get a better job if he wants to make more money.
What I understood in this argument is that he blames me for being poor but the reality is that we’re better off now than when I worked. We’re saving $1500 a month in childcare. I’m bringing in more with my part time than I was by working full time and paying daycare. Our bills are paid! He wants ME to be responsible for his dreams and his goals. 
When I worked, I was an anxious mess. Always in a bad mood and stressed out. He hated it! He told me I was too negative to live with. Now that I’m happy, it bothers him too!
I went from feeling happy and in control to being this mess of a person. I am sobbing at the drop of a hat without warning. I can’t control it. I want to just disappear. I can’t kill myself and I don’t want to but god, I just want to not be here. I don’t want to do this anymore.

However, the last few years have been killing me...I’m only 18 and two years ago my mother died from brain cancer...I was suffering in HS from bullying and more but I managed to push through because she wanted me to.
Now outside of High School..my life has been worse 
My grandmother has been collecting SS benefits from me that I didn’t know about until recently and I’ve never touched any of that 800 bucks a month which I could really use myself to better my situation...
I left home because my home situation wasn’t ideal to say the least..I was staying with homophobic family members who often talked about cutting off gay family members and being disgusted by lgbt folk and even labeling them as racist...as a closeted gay person those words hurt..
In my new place everything was fine until my roommate threatened to physically hurt me because he thinks I molested his cat due to the cat going into heat as soon as I came..I no longer feel safe and he said if he “senses” that I did something to the cat it won’t be pretty and he looks at me with the most hostile eyes.
I don’t make enough money to truly support myself..I can’t find a second job and my current job won’t hire full time...I can barely pay my bills and feed myself so I only really survive off cheap snacks..
My dad essentially abandoned me because I didn’t go to college and because of that doesn’t really want to help me 
I took a small loan from r/borrow because I really needed to get by but I only paid back a small portion of it and I’ve been trying my hardest to get the money..I feel like absolute shit and I’m just done..
I’ve also been sick for the last month or two and I’ve loss sensation in one side of my foot..and at one point both my feet went numb with random spikes of pain and I was unable to walk.. but I’ve been scared to see a doctor 
Maybe these aren’t real issues or anything to be sad about..maybe it’s just my mind playing tricks on me..idk

During weeks, I only wake up to go to school then come back to school and sleep. I’m currently in holidays and it’s worse because I spend my days in my pyjamas on the couch or in my bed in front of the tv or my phone then go to sleep way too late. I have no friends to hang out with and I don’t want to go out alone so I always stay in my house. I have no real interests so I’m bored all day and I’m annoyed if I have to do anything, my homeworks for example. Second, I’m ugly. I’m fat because I don’t do any exercises or sports and also because I principally eat the same junk food everyday. I would like to exercise and eat better but I don’t have the motivation to do it. I also have intestine problems so basically when I’m in school, I’m often scared to crap my pants... Speaking of school, I hate each and every single one of my schoolmates there. They’re dumb, sexist, homophobic, racist, disrespectful etc. I think they are suspecting I’m gay, so they’re starting to provoke me which gives me anxiety. While we are here, I’m gay, and I’m closeted. That’s also something I hate, I can’t be myself because I’m too scared that someone could find out. That fear causes me to not have any clothes I like just because the style I like may be considered ""homo"" by everyone else. For this reason, I’m also scared to have piercing, to dye my hair or to wear some make up, which I really want to do. All that said, I hate that I’m jealous over people on Instagram. I know that it’s not real life, but I can’t help it. They are way more beautiful than me. Their hair, eyebrows, eyes, noses, lips, skins, face shape, clavicles, torsos, legs are just looking way better than mine. I know they are showing the good sides of their lives, but I can’t see a good side in mine. 
I know this is a bit ridiculous, but that’s just my life at this point...
I’m already seeing a therapist but it doesn’t help and I don’t want someone to feel sorry for me. Anyway, the exercises she told me to do are useless. My parents also don’t know that I hate my life like it is, they think it’s alright with me. So, what could I do? Can someone give me some advices? (If possible..)

Said it wasn't that he didn't love me or didn't want to be with me. He just needed me to be patient. I've been spiraling. I'm not sure how to help him or how to support him. He's pulled away, very distant, even when I reach out. There's such a lack of desire to interact with me that it's just breaking my heart slowly. He's a great person and I love him, deeply. 
There's so much literature about how to interact with a loved one that's depressed, but there's not much about the impact of the other spouse. I feel sad most of the time and hurt, I feel myself pulling away from my friends and him, and all I want to do is cry.",1

I don’t think I can take it anymore... you brought me so much confusion I didn’t even know what I was to you yet you still told me you loved me constantly. I’m not mad that you got me pregnant and stopped talking to me right before my surgery.... I’m not even mad at you, I love you and I always will. You were my whole universe. Everything else around me didn’t matter and thinking like that made me lose so many friends but I didn’t seem to care at the time. You probably never loved me. You lied to me about having a girlfriend when I first met you and you cheated because of me. She left you and kept me around for almost a year. I miss you so so much. You caused me so much pain I don’t even understand why I loved you so much, I tried ending my life the day you left and it was the last time I ever self harmed. You prevented my relapsing but in the end you caused it. I thought I was doing okay but I’m not... I’m really not, after you left me I started realizing everything that’s happened and I started caring about it, all those friends I lost, the fights with my family, how I’ve been in and out of psych wards and how my body is covered in scars. 
You are not a good person you were never able to keep a relationship and I was probably your longest one. I’m also most likely the only girl that wasn’t the one to leave... I’m not sure if you were waiting or expecting me too because it seems like that’s pretty common for you. I hope you realize that this isn’t going to get you anywhere.
I still care about you so so much and I want you to get your shit together. 
I’m trying to get over you but at the same time I want you to come back. 
I’ll always be here, I’ll wait. I don’t care about the pain you caused me I miss you and I need you; the only thing is I don’t know how much longer I can wait for you, I’m waiting for absolutely nothing and I might as well just do it... 
You took my breathe away from me, I couldn’t breathe and I can barely pretend that I’m fine anymore. You were my home, I want my home back. 
It’s almost been exactly two months. I’m still waiting and I’ll never stop until you come back please... I want to sleep again I want to be able to eat and I want to look at something without thinking of you.

My Parents asked why my grades are slipping this quarter, I decided to be honest told them I'm unmotivated to do anything. Maybe I should've lied and said 'oh my b, i'll do better next time' because they got real mad that I am unmotivated and told me to 'adjust' this mindset. I can tell they are very disappointed that I'm letting up during the 'most important year for college', 11th grade.
 Anyway, what I can remember from the scolding are two things: if I don't go to an elite university I'm going to bring shame to the family, and also that they had spent some $$ for SAT tutoring so I need to guarantee a 1500+. 
Deep down, answer is no. I don't have much confidence in myself. But i know saying no to these questions will not get me anywhere, so I just said answered ""yes"".
I Have been contemplating suicide for quite a while because I have felt like a failure for almost always not getting things done on time, for being so unmotivated, for being a disorganized mess, being incompetent at everything i do; this is my breaking point, i guess.
I know its just some stupid numbers, but if I don't make it past 1500 on the SAT, i might actually do it; it'll be the last time I'll disappoint someone",1

I want to ask for help but my parents already take care of my illness meds and I can no longer ask for a therapist because it's costs a lot. Am just... So hopeless. This hasn't happened before. I was depressed and anxious for weeks months on end but never hopeless. Never so tired to just end this. My life as a whole seems so pointless... It's not a sad feeling. It's more like 'Whats the purpose of my existence... There's nothing. So why am I here? Why should I be here when nothing makes sense' 
I feel like I should really let go. Maybe in the next life. I want to travel, I want to laugh again and I want to hold the love of my life's hand but I don't think it's ever happening in this lifetime. I am just so useless.. maybe I will be useful in the next one.",1

So good in fact that I never even realized that’s why I was getting so upset at little things people would say or do to me. I would just bottle it away and keep a straight face then snap at someone eventually and then they would leave me. But even now that I’ve found what’s been causing it I’m alone. I’ve driven everyone away. I am so alone that it’s made me a desperate freak that clings to anyone who shows me sympathy, and then pushes those people out forever. I create my own sadness.
I sincerely wish I had the courage to take my own life. I think it about doing it everyday now and I really just want someone to confide in. But I’m not going to find that here, or anywhere else. For someone like me, who struggles to speak one full sentence to another human being everyday, people like that don’t come often. Even if they did I would find a way to fuck it up like I’ve done countless times in the past. I’ve never felt so truly alone. Completely helpless. Beyond help.

I never even got my chance to live, and now I’m at an age where I’m expected to “give back to the community” that never supported me to begin with.
I’ve tried therapy with multiple different people from different mental health professions, for years. I’m still depressed, in fact, some of them were abusive and traumatic. I’ve tried multiple different medicines at strong doses for long periods of time. No effect whatsoever, although they did cause some lingering health problems. I eat well, do hobbies, talk to my friend, take care of myself, everything. It doesn’t get any better.

test_pid_1423,"28M - I feel broken : I honestly don't know how much more I can take of the bullshit my life has thrown at me. I had a great start in life, loving family full of integrity, character and pride. Hard workers. All had good qualities. And yet here I am 28 stuck living at home, unemployed the last year. My life and identity has fallen to pieces and it's only getting worse.
My dads 84 and mums 70. I tried for so long to be successful. Try and hold on to being strong etc. Keep trying. But this last ten years my life has just fallen apart piece by piece and I feel powerless over it anymore. 
I did well at school and went to college for 4 years but every job I have had has been soul destroying. Multiple family deaths. Ex girlfriend as a teenager messed me up a lot.  I lost a lot of integrity in a downward spiral after going through a lot more shit. Dog had to be put down last week. Everyone else is having kids buying houses or living their life and I can barely get out of bed. Then I beat myself up over the fact my life's getting/got away from me. My ego is shattered - I've tried being more 'spiritual'. But nothing seems to work. It's not Great Britain anymore it's be a cunt or get treated like a cunt. And I've been both ends of the spectrum. 
Even if I get a job what then? I've already lost myself 100%. Broken dreams, identity and goals. My friends have all done well for themselves but for me things never quite worked out. It's hard to not feel like you were never good enough. Which is ironic as everyone growing up seemed to see me as a leader.  But there we have it. I'm a failure. 
All I really wanted was a life filled with love and positivity. Nothing extravagant. I didn't need it. Yet the moment your work life or lack of is fucked up your entire life falls to pieces. 
I'm utterly jaded, broken and feel helpless. My life and the things I've been through have destroyed me and I just don't see the point anymore. I don't even have a libido anymore. Let alone sex.  
From the outside though I still seem confident and one of them people her are 'put together'. But the inside of me has crumbled into nothing. 
I keep telling myself these dark days will pass. But it's been years now to the point I'm more comfortable in the dark then the light. 
I'm getting through enjoying little things like food. But I don't feel like a fucking man anymore. 
What is a man without his sense of who he is? Is legacy? His purpose? And the impact he has on those in his life?
I feel like deadweight that everyone is slowly turning their back on and it fucking hurts.

I always read this shit but never joined cause whatever but now I've realized that my loneliness is so much deeper than I realized. I cant even get a fucking earlier apointment with my therapist when I'm in crisis that's how alone i fuckin am. Cant even pay someone to talk to me whenever I want I have to wait for it. Fuckin goddam emotional prostitute is all a therapist really is cause you know they dont actually fuckin care about your life but I just have no one else to fuckin turn to. Just so I can break down and be told itll get better? Are you fucking kidding me I'm 21 life only goes downhill from here I only see you once a month cause that's all I can afford how much change are we gonna get done in 50 minutes. I realized the other day I dont have any fuckin friends just people I get high with. Just people who dont care about my fuckin life and never ever fuckin listen. I've been swept to the trash bin of society to no fault of my own and I just keep fading deeper and deeper into nothing. I've suffered so fuckin much but today, today was the day I finally fell over that fuckin edge I was teetering on for so long cause I decided to take that therapists advice and attempt to form relationships with woman. I should never have listened to her cause I'm a short hideous fat fuckin loser with a tiny dick therefore romantic relationships are off the table for me but then I realised deep down inside I wasnt actually dying to have sex or find a girlfriend, I just wanted to actually know what it was like to finally talk to a woman for more than 5 min that wasnt related to me. So I created a tinder and bumble profile and after so long of no matches whatsoever voila low and behold I match with a gorgeous girl with the same music taste as me! I messaged her and somehow someway we talked all day! She gave me her number!!! It was totally incredible for the first time in my life I was actually fuckin happy and I write  that sobing my fuckin eyes out because i finally felt true fuckin happiness for the first time since I was a child. I've never felt such a feeling before it was the feeling of cocaine or meth without the energy and only the euphoria but didnt go away and just felt so natural and real instead of artificial and toxic. I was happy for the first time in my life talking to a actual girl not flirting or sexting but so much deeper then that. all I actually wanted to do, talk with a girl whom seemed to like talking to me. After waking up everyday for so long feeling like 50% of the worlds population wants nothing to do to me a simple conversation about music and sports made me feel like a fuckin human for once. And then out of no where the unthinkable happend... she suggested we go skiing together and shed teach me how to ski!!! You know that feeling of happiness I said I felt before well that felt like chicken shit compared to what I experienced in that moment. That truly was the happiest moment of my life and I was so filled with hope for what could be my future, not explicitly one with her but one that had friends. I replied instantly and tried to organize something............ and I've been ghosted for 2 days. I refuse to double text or call her. no person whod actually be intrested wouldn't remember to message back. I've never felt so broken in my fuckin existence no matter how bad the comedown or withdrawal no matter how bad the abuse I've endured no matter how neglected someone has treated me it just simply doesnt compare to the soul shattering emptiness that has consumed me today. What kind of sadistic fuck does that? Why couldn't I have been simply rejected? Why did she have ask me out to do me such wrong. What joy does it bring her what test is she putting me through? How little must you care about another person to be so cruel. All I wanted to fucking do was for the first time in my life know what it was like to hang out with a woman. Fuck the fact I could have held hands for the first time fuck the fact I could have hugged a woman who wasnt related to me for the first time fuck the fact that in some parallel dimension I could have had my first kiss.

BUT I cannot deal with the amount of effort I have to put in. To get a date with someone I have to keep constantly talking and keeping her interested, which I don't know how and I can only learn from practice, but it also makes really tired mentally and I feel even worse about myself after talking to someone and I catch even the most minor signal of them not being interested. I can't boost my ego. Plus, everything feels pointless to me. Every activity. I feel that there is nothing out there to keep me interested long enough. I feel my friends drifting away because I refuse to go out because I don't feel like it. It just takes a big toll on me to go on clubs and bars. I don't feel in control, I feel very lost. I had panic attacks now not so much. I have no creative outlets and I feel like I have been drained by any ounce of joy and creativity I ever had. And I don't know why. I sleep a lot, but never feel rested. I have an appetite that has its own mind. I want to talk to someone about my problems but whatever they say to me I have already said it to myself. I have tried therapy, I didn't feel any better. I couldn't open up. I can never open up. I keep my true self for me and me only. And this is killing me.

test_pid_1442,"Living on my own for the first time; best friends boyfriend makes me feel like shit constantly : I’ve been struggling with depression for about 5 years now, and this past year I finally reached a personal goal of moving out on my own for the first time at 26. 
My best friend and her boyfriend as well as one other guy are living with me, and that’s why I am able to afford to live here.
Despite it helping me for a while I inevitably started struggling with the usual stuff again after a few months, and that’s when her boyfriend really started to show his colors in terms of what he thought of me.
Her boyfriend is an extremely practical, very numbers-kind of guy, and also, according to the way he talks to me, never forgets anything or makes honest mistakes.
I do understand that I need to be better about things, remember to do them on time and such, but the way he talks to me makes me almost not want to do them because I feel even less motivation or drive to get the fuck up and do them. It takes all of the VERY little energy I have and crushes it.
Sometimes it even happens that I am doing a task and accomplishing something well for once and he messages telling me to do it NOW and it just undermines my whole feeling good that I’m out of bed, doing something and being healthy.
He has,in the past,said things to me like:
“The great lindsey manages to mess up again!”
“How do you not remember to do this thing? Are you stupid?”
“YOU FORGOT TO TAKE YOUR LAUNDRY OUT AGAIN???”
*yes in all caps
This happens in a group chat that everyone sees.
I’ve told my best friend how I feel and while she says she understands, she obviously sticks up for him a bit because she sleeps with him, spends every day with him, has feelings for him, etc.
She chalks a lot of it up to his cultural background (he’s from India) and says that he’s just like that, but I often feel as if she dismisses the fact that I don’t even like being around him because I feel he despises me and thinks I’m a lazy idiot, despite knowing that I have mental health issues.
A lot of the things have been more minor, too. 
Putting mail on the table instead of the mail basket he bought for us.
Putting either too many or too little dishes in the dishwasher. (I still don’t know which I am guilty of, he’s said I do both all the time)
Accidentally nudging the little handle on the bathtub once.
Idk, maybe I am really a shitty person to live around and be with, but i feel like I’ve put more effort in the last year than I was before, with having real jobs and paying bills and such, but it’s still a daily struggle to even exist, and I just want to not wake up to someone berating me in all caps.",1
test_pid_1443,"I Am Coasting Through Life : I made this account so I can vent out my feelings. I am so confused on where I am in my life. I dont know how I feel anymore. I pretend that my emotions are null, but I'm so sad its unbearable. I think I'm suicidal, but I can't bare the thought of killing myself. I don't know how. I don't want to be damned to some dimension like heaven or hell. I want to feel blackness.
Here is my problem. Ever since I was 14 (I am 17 now.), I have lost any real reason to care about anything. Slowly, I started caring less and less about everything. However some things I still care about. However, my grades have increasingly stagnated to the point where I might not graduate with my class. 
My parents scream at me to keep them up...however I csnt find a reason to actually care about them. I just will coast through it. It does not matter. It just saddens me that I cant find even the slightest motivation to do it. Even though I wont graduate with my class, it doesnt make me motivated to fix them.
What I do think about in class often is my death. Death of others...how I would kill myself, how people would react to my death. I don't know how to stop them. I just think about suicide and killing myself every day, and it clouds my memory to the point that I cant remember anything from something I've done just merely minutes ago.
My parents reactions to my death don't bother me at all, since I've already accepted what and how they would react. 
However, this girl from another school...I caught feelings for her. I dont understand how I did, because I have not felt any petty ass crush on someone in a minute. She is starting to slowly grow on me. I am having dreams about her, nightmares more like. I cant bare the thought of not having her as my friend.
Yet I feel she is growing ever more distant day by day. She makes me feel weird...I choke up when I talk to her. I cant look at her anymore...it will make me cry...I dont want to leave her, ever...but I feel like she knows she has more potential in life more than I...
I talk to her about everything. She knows how I feel, but I feel like I am pressuring her. I love her, I cant stand it. I want my crush to go away, but I cant bare another day without her. Its agonizing and embarrassing. I dont know what's wrong with me.
I am scared to tell my parents to tell them that I am having suicidal thoughts. I'm not going to tell them. They told me there is nothing wrong with me when I told them I was unhappy in this house. They just said that I was ungrateful and I didnt appreciate anything.
Are they right? Am I being dramatic? What should I tell her? Why do I not care about anything except her?",1
test_pid_1444,"Just a rant : If I had to guess when it all started I’d have to say that I probably saw my first signs of depression around 12. It’s just been recently that I started seeing a therapist and she told my parents and I that I have depression. She told my therapist that she wouldn’t be surprised if that was true. After she said that I don’t know why but I just broke down. It just really hurt me to hear that my mom knew that I had depression and even suspected it but never once tried to help me. 
It’s gotten a lot worst in the last 4 months and school’s also been majorly impacted. I used to go to the gym, parties, do well in school but these days I can’t find the motivation to just get out of bed. Earlier today I was going to my room to go to sleep because I didn’t want to be awake. She saw that and just lost her shit, talking about how useless I am and how I can’t even do anything. I couldn’t even argue back because I couldn’t find a reason to. I knew everything she was saying was true. When I laid down she was still yelling and I just broke down again.

test_pid_1449,"Depression because of social problems : Does anyone else get this? I think my depression comes from my social problems. I'm a 24m and I just have a really hard time trying to feel psychologically normal I guess. For example, I struggle every day with my self-image and overall concept of self. This also is a result of my social problems; ever since I was very young (5 years old when I started school)  I've struggled to feel secure and good about my place among my peers. Ever since that time I've always worried about how people saw me, and I've never really been able to feel secure in who I am. 
I'm plagued with social anxiety and I'm honestly very very cowardly when it comes to ""working on it"", which I really don't ""do""; only in baby steps have I confronted it, but I don't challenging myself regularly. It's like my brain does not want me to try at all, as if ""being  social"" is the exact opposite of what my brain wants me to be. On top of that, my social skills aren't that great anyways. It actually perplexes me how much I actively DON'T understand about socializing. For instance, I never thought about conversational rhythm, but I read about it not to long ago. My problem is I can't immediately see or apply these things. Learning them is so painfully slow. I literally just ""tuned in"" to the rhythm of a short phone call I just made, and it felt so weird and unnatural. It's something I often thought I was picking up on, but I just don't if I don't sit there with my feelings for a second. 
And then there's the fact that emotional connection with other people feels so wrong. That's why I can't legitimately get excited for things even if the group/crowd is; my brain always puts me on the outside of these situations, as if it is actively blocking me from sharing in that moment with people. And you can see how that actually makes me VERY awkward and sort of vaguely unpleasant to others. I can't make quick positive relationships with people, like with customers at my job for example, because my brain feels so wrong in ACTUALITY enjoying a moment with someone. 
I'm also just a needy fuck. Despite not really being social, I constantly think of people I used to consider friends and long for them, but I can't reach out. That would be an attempt at emotional connection, which I am bad at, and which is coming from a very needy place. I feel like I'd be doing a disservice to people at worse by trying to be friends with them. Everything that comes out of my mouth feels forced because it is. For over a year sincev""trying to overcome all this stuff. That's all the energy I have for this. I don't know. Shit just sucks.

test_pid_1458,"Should I work on graveyard shift or not? : Hi, I badly need an advice.
SHORT VERSION:
I don't want to work on graveyard shift, fearing it will trigger my depression.
I have 3 options:
1. Ask for doctor's certificate to work on morning.
2. Submit resignation letter.
3. Face graveyard shift head-on and gamble my health and life there.
LONG VERSION:
Since January this year, I have been working on a morning shift (6AM-4pm). I requested this to my leads because I was already burnt out because I used to work on the busiest mid shift (12noon-10pm) for 3 years. So far, morning shift is the best — I can eat healthy foods on time, sleep 4-8 hrs, get to do my hobbies after shift.
However, I heard that I will be transferred to graveyard shift (9pm-7pm). It's not yet final, but it has high chances of getting implemented because people working on graveyard are now getting sick so we will swap. The problem is that I have worked graveyard last 2018, Apr-May. In a way, it contributed to me getting antidepressants months later on September of that same year. That was my 3rd time to take antidepressants. 1st was in 2012, I was in college. 2nd was in 2014, I was in my previous work.
The reason for my depression is not quite clear, too much overprotective parents, very low self esteem, me not talking to people, fucked up sleep, unhealthy diet, my inability to prioritize important tasks, etc. Currently, things are working well (not totally but at least I have made small effective efforts) and I'm afraid working on graveyard might trigger my illness. I did not want to live in constant fear of depression but wouldn't diabetics avoid sugar? Wouldn't people with gallstones and high blood pressure avoid fatty foods? Why would I not avoid a graveyard shift that will fuck up my sleep and other daily routines.
I have 3 options.
1. Visit my psychiatrist and request for a medical certificate, which I don't know is something he would issue because there are worst depression cases than me. But I will still try to talk to him later today.
2. Submit a resignation letter. I already submitted a resignation letter last year but I retracted it after all 4 of my leads talked to me worrying because they know I don't have a backup job waiting for me and I have a mortgage with 13 more years of terms. Some of them also want me to stay because they saw my potential in our work. BUT, recently, I bought a laptop which will enable me to find an online job that pays better and requires less hours of work. But it's a huge gamble because only heaven knows how fast I can find a job.
3. Face graveyard shift straight to it's face and:
3.a. I'll be OK and manage to sleep well on daytime.
3.b. I'll get screwed and be depressed again and be on antidepressants and get well, then decide again what to do with my career when that happens.
3.c. I'll get screwed really screwed that no amount of antidepressants can help me and that I'll eventually you know... cross the line... to the point of no return.
PS. I work as part of a DevOps team, handling critical issues and occasional programming. Salary is decent for my needs. I'm single and feeds nobody but myself. I have no savings. But when things get worse I can always sell my house, which is on mortgage, yes I can. I can also go home to my parents when things get fucked up but that's not my goal here. :(",1

test_pid_1460,"Feeling Happy and Enjoying Life for Once : I was twelve when I noticed something in me change. The way I thought of the world changed. Instead of me living on Earth, I felt like I was constantly fighting to find my purpose for being on this planet. I felt insignificant compared to everything. I felt like that annoying side character no likes or asked for. I have felt this way for most of my life. I felt hollow and alone stuck under a cloud of darkness. Everything I did or touched was tainted by my negative presence. I pushed away everyone, kept them all at arms distance. Because I felt this constant pressure following me everywhere. I screamed for help. But I felt like no one understood, no one could hear, no one cared. Except one. I know her more than I could ever payback. She saw my pain. She felt my pain. She helped me the best she could and for that, I appreciate her more than most people in my life. One day when I was sixteen, I felt my chest tighten. I felt like someone turned off the oxygen switch. I felt the room spin and close in on itself. It was my first anxiety attack. Shortly after that, I attended therapy for the first time. I enjoyed it, but my family thought it was a waste soo. I stopped. Throughout my life, I have been up and very down. There was a point where I thought about plunging a kitchen knife into myself and just letting myself bleed there on the cold floor. And then there were moments when my brother and I were driving in the car blasting music. It was bliss. But as always the negative tends to overtake the positive. I struggled a lot. With everything. I failed classes and flunked out of nursing school. That was my lowest low. I felt like I failed everyone and like I did not deserve to live or to be cared for. I dedicated myself to work. I found comfort in care for others. I fell in love with nursing again. I finally now have a medication combo that works for me. I found something to dedicate myself to. I have found a purpose, a reason to live, a reason to exist. I am here to say the darkness never truly goes away. I know how cliche and how some of you have heard that time and time again. But, slowly it gets more manageable. Be patient. I am 20 right now. And I can say with confidence I do not have my shit together. But I have realized something no one else does either. It is okay, to not be okay. Take a deep breath. Play devil's advocate, find reasons to live and keep saying them out loud. Eventually, you won't have to convince yourself.",1

Im from Pakistan and cousin marriages are normal or at least they aren't looked down upon. My moms parents told my mom to get me married to my mom's sister's daughter when we were born so both of us grew up knowing we would get married in the future so we never took each other as cousins or brother/sister. Also i moved to UK when i was 8 and she stayed in Pakistan. now when we both are 20 our parents told me they were going to get me engaged and i said no to it but than i got a lot of emotional blackmail for a month from my mom and her side of the family. 2 things that hurt me the most was my mom saying shes going back to Pakistan because she does not want my sibling who are under 14 to become anything like me and them saying i used my cousin because she has imagined her future with only me and im betraying her and ruining her life. I gave in and said fine to the engagement because i felt like shit and i already have depression and anxiety and since everyone was saying i will change my mind afterwards and since i am not dating anyone i agreed but i didn't go back home my parents went and actually made a really big deal of it because im their first born. 2 week after the engagement and telling myself that this is a good thing, it will work out, i will be happy i am back to panic mode and feeling trapped. Now here's the thing she is very nice, way better looking than me but i am still not attracted to her and im not talking about looks im just talking personality wise she wants to be the traditional housewife and i just want a friend since i literally felt alone my whole life also i cant get over the fact that she is my cousin even though its normal in my family her parents are first cousins and mine are third cousins so if i do get married i will not have kids that's for sure i will adopt or go a different route and that's an issue as well since she wants kids and thinks nothing will happen to our kids now i understand that kids could be perfectly healthy but if they are not i will hate myself forever so I will never take that chance since we are cousins. I just need advice and opinions on this situation because i love my parents and i know they love me and its not my cousins fault either because to her cousin marriage is normal and she grew up thinking she will marry me and she didn't date anyone else and has told me she will not marry anyone else if not me and will stay single for the rest of her life which is making me think that i am ruining her life which is driving me insane to point where i am thinking of ways to end my life to avoid upsetting my parents, families back home and my cousin and just escaping all this bs.

test_pid_1470,I don’t even know what happened : Literally I was out with a friend and their friends and they were having a jam session playing guitar and everything and suddenly everything seemed so distant. My chest got really tight and the world felt like it was shrinking around me. My breathe started getting short and I had to leave immediately. She asked if I was okay and I couldn’t respond. I finally got some words out and She tried to kiss me goodbye but I just couldn’t stand still. I basically ran to the other side of my car and wished her a good night and I left. I texted her and apologized and she seems to understand but I just feel so gross. I was probably on the verge of a panic attack but I don’t know what triggered it,1
test_pid_1471,"Vent. I’m Hispanic yet people think I’m Asian. : I’m getting annoyed over this. It never bothered me until a few years ago. Everyone thinks I’m Asian (nothing wrong against being Asian but it’s annoying how people of my own kind talk crap in Spanish). I’m short so no one takes me seriously, if I do anything it’s overcompensating. I’ve been fucked over many times and because I’m short I get ignored. Half the time I want to hurt people but I can’t because again I’m compensating. Yet if I try to do anything, I pretty much end up being chaptered out. I look young so everyone thinks I’m a child. I’ve lost my potential in life because indirectly I feel like I’m invisible or like I’m a kid. It drove me to my limits and tbh I know I have a permanent problem. Ohh I also am an addict so anything I try I get hooked on easily. I feel immature to even other people and I’m never hispanic enough. My dad felt the same but he died 3 years ago. Idk. My hope and dreams are over so I’m just idk. Idk. 
I’m a permanent problem that needs a permanent solution. No matter what I can’t tell anyone that without being sent to the looney bin. Everyone says I’m so stiff and robotic. Every day I search on how to be normal or the next drug to finally be myself again but I’ve had no luck. I’ve been taking phenibut but now i take it because I’m avoiding withdrawal symptom.

I can’t even look them in the eye, but I would do and try to do anything I can for them to make sure they’re happy and enjoying their work.

test_pid_1476,"I’m at my lowest point : I feel as if I’ve been at a steady decline for a long time now, but I think that right now I’ve hit true rock bottom. About a week ago I had a seizure out of nowhere which almost killed me, my mother had to resuscitate me on the ground (she’s a nurse) and I was taken to the ER. There’s a possibility I might have epilepsy. I had been really sick for about a week when it happened so it could’ve resulted from a really bad fever, but according to my mom there’s a 50/50 shot that I might have epilepsy, which has been like crushing me. It horrifies me that it would get in the way of things that distract me/make me happy. It’s all I’ve been able to think about. I’ve been severely depressed for about 3 years now, and that just pushed it even deeper. Every single day for the last week I’ve had suicidal thoughts. I found myself wishing that the seizure had killed me and my mother hadn’t saved me. I just feel worthless, and completely blank if that makes any sense. I feel if I had immediate access to a firearm I would be dead by now. I genuinely did not think it could get worse, but over the course of a week I have gotten more suicidal than I have ever been. I want to be a little kid again. Back when I was curious about the world and eager to learn things, before I was on any drugs, when I loved both my parents and I had a really solid friend group and I didn’t have a care in the world.

test_pid_1477,"Why am I so weak? : Today someone told me in passing that I need to have more self-discipline. Then I started crying. The other day someone told me they didn’t want to be my friend, and I started crying. I’m failing two classes in school and I’m crying right now because of it. Somebody blocked me yesterday and i fucking started crying. My dog doesn’t like me enough and sometimes I cry because of that. When people don’t respond to my texts I start crying. Why am I so easily reduced to tears? Why do I throw tantrums about such little things? Why am I so disgusting?",1
test_pid_1478,"Something has to change : To me, life feels like the line from Alice in Wonderland ""Here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere, you must run twice as fast as that."" I feel like I'm either running as fast as I can and getting nowhere, and sometimes even trying to run twice as fast to make things better, then inevitably when it becomes to much I trip and set myself back. I'm either putting in the effort, or crumbling because I no longer can. Rinse and repeat. 
I have almost nothing stressful in my life and plenty of good things going for me. I am married to a loving and supportive man, we don't have any children yet, I only work short shifts twice a week at a job that isn't stressful in a positive environment, I have great friends and family... the list of positives goes on. However, I have had some serious challenges in recent years, and I feel like I am emotionally drained from them even though they are in the past, and it's keeping me from enjoying my life now and making things better. I find myself unable to keep up with my minimal load without periodic meltdowns. I feel like I'm running on an empty gas tank, and anytime something unpleasant happens I am unable to cope. 
Some examples of the things that trigger my meltdowns are having to visit with friends and family when I'm not feeling up to it (which is most times we plan anything together), minor frustrations that build up and cause me to blow, needing to eat when I haven't done groceries or cleaned the kitchen, or pretty much anything that makes me frustrated or requires energy beyond what I feel I have at the moment. I don't know how I can make things any easier for myself, or why I can't just cope with the bad and enjoy the good things. As soon as something triggers me I'm reminded of whatever the deeper issue at play is, how they are all connected and my fault, and I spiral out of control. I feel like I'm ruining my husband's life and wasting mine, but I don't know how to stop. Part of me wants to reduce my stress by taking a step back from everything and everyone, but it can't get much easier. I try to stop the spiral before it gets too bad, and sometimes I'm able to do so but too often I can't, and the only thing that seems to make me successful in doing so is when things don't continue to go wrong, which I have no control over.
Any advice you have to help me break this pattern would be so helpful. Also, any advice for how to contain my reaction so that I don't make things awful for my husband would be helpful as well. Thanks  guys.",1

Ok so I got up and got dressed and did my makeup agian tonight I wore it for 5 minutes but I see a progress. Like I said in my recent post I saw my beautiful self agian. I’m thinking I will try to do this every night for a while: get fully ready and then get un ready. It gives me a reminder I am beautiful and alive as well as still me. Now trust me I know I won’t always want to get up to do this, I didn’t want to today... but i did and i feel ever so slightly better. A small progress... this is hard for me to do as my anxiety and depression has become crippling and I never leave the house/ or get dressed. I even wore my old cloths which is hard because I have developed sensory issues I believe. But the point of all of this is that even tho it was for five minutes I felt like myself agian, I felt alive. I realize that I can’t die because there is this beautiful girl that I am that wants to live. I really think you should try this or something similar  get up for a short time or just stay in bed... and do something that the non depressed you would want to do. Now it’s ok if it ends negative and you have a breakdown. That has happened to me previously but in my experience those breakdown just showed me even more that I have emotions and I am alive. Just continue trying and then one day you will look at your hobby or yourself and say wow I am “me” 
It would be amazing to have someone to go through this journey with i will try and update posts on the days that I do this... even if it ends not so great.

My life? I don't have one. I hardly finished school and went to college. I thought I was getting better but then I fought with my parents and left my house and was so scared of the world and having so many panic attacks because I literally had no money and was starving that I had to make peace with them and get back.

 I live with my mom (40f) and sister and dad. My mom has been acting weird lately since she got her new job a few years ago. She's just cold and distant and takes her anger out on me all the time. I think sometimes she literally searches for reasons to mad at me. She does the same thing to my dad.
My younger sister (12f) is a spoiled brat and is the ""Golden child"". Mom treats her super nice and buys her anything she wants and she treats me like absolute shit. I just kind of stay away from her.
My dad though (39m) is the nicest person in the world. When he's off we always go and hang out and play pick up at the basketball court. He understands when my mom is acting like a bitch and is a really nice guy. I feel like he's one off the only people in the world that I can be myself around.

The problem is my dad's barely ever off from work. He works from 12pm to 2am most days and since I leave the house to go to school I barely see him. He also works overtime alot as well. 
This means that when I'm home I have to deal with my brat sister and my insane mom. I mostly just go in my room and close the door and draw or watch basketball games on my phone. I only have 1 or 2 close friends but I can't hang out with them alot because my mom doesn't allow it.

test_pid_1525,"My relationship crumbled, lost my job. I see no future. : Hello, whoever reads this. 
I have struggled with depression for a really long time. I fell deeply into depression while I was engaged to my ex fiance. I had numerous events where I wanted so bad to take my life and just be done with it all. Anyways I broke up with my ex fiance because in the last few years of our relationship she stopped caring about me. It ended up being long distance and she made no effort to ever see me. I ended it and then had about 2 and a half years of being alone. My self worth has always been low and I have always felt that everyone around me is better. Throughout life I have never had anyone actually interested in me or willing to give me a shot both in my career and in personal relationships. Anyways as of today, two major things have happened:
I broke up with my ex. After being without anyone for so long I basically jumped into the arms of the first girl who gave me attention. I threw everything at her, unloaded my heart, time, and money for her. I wanted nothing else in the world but to be with her. However, after 5 months all the red flags became clear and I was able to see the bad that I blocked from my mind. She was narcissistic and gas lighted me constantly. She would abuse me mentally and physically all the time, knowing full well that I would roll over. A few times after she verbally berated me I tried to run and block her out of my life...but I would end up stumbling back to her. Yesterday was one of those times. EVERY single time I would crawl back she would tell me how pathetic I was and how much more I would have to work on improving my love to win her over. Even if it involved competing with other men. I ignored all of this and I basically submitted to her. Well.... until today. I was joking around with her saying I would try more and buy her chocolates and so forth. She then out of the blue tells me that she wants to fight my family because they don't approve of her and that she will probably end up in jail... I was taken back by that statement, she then tells me that she believes I won't like her that much after she murders my mom. Me:""Um what?""Her:""Yup, I want to kill her"". I told her to stay the f away and never contact me again. I deleted everything and blocked her completely. 
Right now I am shaking. How can I fall into love with someone so twisted? Did I have that low of self-esteem that I fell into a trap of abuse? My therapist has told me that I continue with the abuse cycle constantly because I just seek love. How messed up am I that I would even choose someone that would think it's okay or funny to mention killing my own mom? How did I miss those warning signs? What is wrong with me? How did enable this to happen? If I had one ex who wanted nothing to do with me, no one for so long, and then a crazy psycho.... What do I expect next? I honestly just wanted some to be interested in me and to give love back. 
Now to my next dilemma. I went on trips for this girl and flew everywhere to her. She demanded me to come to her because if I didn't it wasn't love. I ended up losing my job, my visa expired. I have to leave the country (USA). My entire family is in the states. I have no one back in my home country, I have been applying since December for jobs in Canada and have only gotten three interviews but haven't gotten anything else. I have experience in my field, I have a degree, but nothing is happening.
I feel the floor dropped out from under me. My family is in the same city as me, I don't make friends easily, I fear that once I am alone without a job I might do something. I just don't see a future anymore. I have basically hit rock bottom.",1
test_pid_1526,Everyone on here ignores me most of the time but I just really need help. : I’m going back to uni in a few days then I’m going camping after being back for 3 days.

test_pid_1527,"I wish I could know for sure if my friends actually cared about me. : My mom for the 17 years I’ve been alive has always been tearing me down and I don’t have any self-confidence.
Only within the past two years have I been able to talk to anyone about how I feel and what I’m going through. But at the same time I feel like I deserve to be like this, that I’m a horrible person that doesn’t deserve to feel happy.
I’m constantly paranoid that my closest friends actually hate me and I feel like I forced all of my problems onto them and now they have to deal with my shit.
They never asked for it. I was just too selfish to realize that it was wrong to turn to them.
Every day I hope that maybe they’ll text me and ask me if I’m ok instead of me having to tell them that I feel worthless at 11pm. But nope. They’ll never text first. I’m pretty sure they actively ignore the messages I send them, and I can’t blame them. Why would you want to help someone that ignores all the advice and support you’ve constantly given? Why would you want to help someone that is actively refusing to get better because they’re scared of change?",1
test_pid_1528,"So I’ve applied for long term disability because I honestly don’t know if I’ll ever be mentally well enough to work again : I was at my therapy session earlier this week and the conversation causally turned to work and future employment. Now I’m on leave right now because I was getting major panic attacks at work and it wasn’t manageable. I’d been mostly fine since going on leave but even just talking about returning to work (not even my current job necessarily but any work) and I’m getting chest pains that’s a major indicator that I’m having a panic attack. My short disability is running out and I’m trying to get my work leave extended as well. I might just all out quit the place. I don’t know. It’s not like the job is any good or pays that much. But that being said, even though I never intended to return to that job I wanted to work again and now it seems that I might not be able to. So now my only option is to be a social pariah and leech on society because I can’t get my shit together enough to earn a living like a normal person. It feels like yet another thing that I’ve failed at. I am officially a non functioning human being that costs society more than I’m worth.",1
test_pid_1529,"I decided to stop looking for love and now I can't get over the past mistakes I made pursuing it. How can I forgive myself? F 35 : My ex boyfriend and I broke up nearly a year ago and since the breakup I realized that I've never had a healthy relationship or courtship. Before him I was single for 10+ years and my standards got lower. He was emotionally abusive, financially draining, and a slob. I remember telling myself that he had committed  unlike other men so his behavior was the best I could hope for. 
My only love interest since was my roommate, he played mind games and wasted my time. I realized with this most recent disappointment that I'm not very good at love. I've never had someone I like feel the same way and treat me well. I'm not giving up but I've given up pursuing love, it's been a waste of my time like religion. I'm mildly depressed about this. 
I'm having flashbacks of my ex boyfriend doing really mean or inconsiderate things daily. I get angry with myself all over again; I feel like I haven't come far with how I allowed my most recent crush to treat me either and It's making me mad at myself.  I don't know how to forgive myself or have compassion.
I also live with my former crush so it's been hard getting over him.  There is a pattern in my life where I can't get love or the guy only wants me after he's mistreated me a million times and I have moved on. I know that I'm a great person worthy of love but I can't help but feel that something is wrong with me for failing to have things be mutual. It makes me ? my intelligence and attractiveness too.
How can I forgive myself for dating my ex and for liking my former crush? I told myself today that even if I could date my former crush I wouldn't because he is disrespectful and I deserve a guy who treats me right. How can I belive that maybe someday someone I like will treat me well?",1

-I'm probably overeating.
-I'm isolating myself more and more
-I always wear headphones so I can avoid saying hi or small talk with ppl i know
-some ppl have noticed my isolating more by joking about it. Also, today, it was one of my dormmate's bday today (I'm in college rn) and I said happy birthday (with my headphones in so i can gtfo after saying hb) and heard the comment along the lines of ""he said something,"" pretty much highlighting how I'm more Isolate
-I'm binge listening (if that's a thing) to emo music, which I do normally listen to, but usually in the background/without being too emotionally invested
Granted I'm not suicidal and don't want to self harm
----------------------just me ranting/spilling things out after this point, ao yeah, if you wanna read, go for it. It's just a heads up in case you're short on time or smth--‐---------------‐------
I have been just a bit down for awhile. Idk if it's bc the fact that a small group of my dormmates have been treating me like shit (many of the other dormmates are great), but are often in the common room. As a result, I've resorted to isolation as a means to avoid then including me using headphones to fake not hearing them. Sadly, this has caused me to apply this ""faking not hearing"" and isolation to everyone in the common room. However, I do say hi to most of my few acquaintance I know outside my dorm.
IDK, what to do. I want to be able to recomnect with the few chill ppl who are in the common room, but dont want to deal with the assholes out there.
I can't stand up for myself, bc the assholes have in a sense gained credibility in the commonroom, as they have been out there more and have therefore been able to naturally build trust. As a result, if I do stand up for myself, they can just spreat lies about me and shit talk me more, which will cost me the few ppl Im chill with in the common room.
As of the beef I have with those ppl who I'm trying to stay away from, these people have taken shit from me without returning them and have been shit talking me like saying "", WhAt ArE yOu DoInG hErE? YoU sHoUlDnT bE hErE"" in the dorms I live in and shit like that.
They've pretty much stopped after going into heavy isolation and seemed to have been nicer by trying to say hi. The thing is that I can't trust them bc it's a pattern of behavior for them to act nice, then go back to being shit after some mild isolation (ive done periodic and mild isolation before).
So yeah, #BigSad. I still have hobbies that I enjoy though and have been imroving in those hobbies tho, so that's something I have going for me at least :D. My grades aren't too good tho, and my concentration when it comes to studying is shit tho. The lack of concentration is something I'm lowkey concerned about too, cuz I zone out alot. The few ppl I've talked to also said that their concention is shit too in their classes too, so idk.",1

My sister told me she have it much worse and she isn't even depressed yet so why am I depressed? I never feel like i'm worth anything, everyone hates me and wanted me to die so why can't I? because i'm a coward, i'm too scared to hurt myself, because it hurts (duh) and sometime I hope that I could cut myself deeper and begone from this horrible place, but I love my mom and grandma and I am scared of how they will reacted.

test_pid_1550,"this weird thing i do to “help” : I watch those videos on youtube where they gather a group of people who have had friends/family that have committed suicide. I watch the videos to hear them talk about how personally hard and difficult it has been since the person they cared about and loved committed suicide. I then picture my own family in their shoes, like literally imagining my family in the video. I picture that it’s my own mom getting interviewed, I picture how broken and sad she would be. How destroyed and heartbroken she would feel or any member of my family would feel. That’s why I watch those videos, to force myself to be reminded that suicide effects more than just one person. I could never put the people I care most about through that, i hope. It’s a constant cycle i go through of having those thoughts, wanting all the pain to stop. Then, after awhile, realizing all that it would accomplish would just be me putting all that pain onto other people I love and care about and understanding that’s literally the last thing I would ever want to put them through. 
I’m not really sure how to end this post. I never plan on making these with the intent on people actually reading them, they are more for just myself kinda, I don’t feel comfortable talking about this with anyone but I still need to get my thoughts out of my head somehow or I will go crazy, so this is what that is used for. Basically me just screaming into an empty void, venting my problems away.

But now the stress of being alone is crushing me. Not only financially but mentally and I no longer feel like the happy bubbly person I used to be. I feel like a shell and I can’t seem to find anything that makes me feel better. 
All my friends checked on me at first asking me how I was doing, but since I’m still sad it seems like they have reached their limit on listening and hanging out with me because I’m not happy anymore.
Everyone is moving on. I took 10 spaces back. I tried to make new friends and connect with old one but people either flake on me or just ghost me completely. 
I’m only 33, but I feel like I’m tired of trying, tired of waking up everyday. I don’t want to be a burden on people anymore. 
I spent 10 years telling my husband who had anxiety and severe depression how much life was worth living but I honestly stopped believing myself 
In the past few years a few friends have committed suicide. While I was heartbroken I felt so guilty because I envied them that they were done and free from this sad and painful life. 
If I did the same it would absolutely crush the people in my life. It devastates me that I have to keep living just to not hurt other people.

Days earlier I was pushing hard, having a little pride on the things i am doing. Now, I feel like I given up. My thinking of who I am is starting to become a reality. I see myself as an outsider, a nobody, a teacher.
However, i'm starting to undergo social withdrawal. I'm scared its going to develop to a point where I will just suicide because I'm not strong enough anymore. I usually write fiction to calm myself and cheer myself up. Today I been writing a story about someone giving their all to a point where they are falling apart, but they still get up and motivate other people. Eventually even they fell. This fiction is a part of me almost like a ""this is what going to happen""
It's starting to happen right now, every time I ask for help I get the feeling that no one understands me. Sometimes they say "" im going through it to"" then nothing. I'm left here still in pain.
Sometimes I just get ignored.

A couple days ago he offered to take me out for dinner. I didn't want to go but I decided to anyway. When we got to the restaurant I told him I didn't want anything to eat and I basically just sat there and watched him eat while I drank soda and played on my phone. I don't like eating in front of people or going inside restaurants to eat which is why I didn't eat. Plus I just wasn't in the mood to hangout and wanted to go home. 
Earlier today I went to his house. We just hung out for a little bit. Then I ended up giving him a blowjob. He pulled my pants and undies off and went down on me for a couple minutes. In the middle of it my phone started ringing and I told him it felt great but I have to answer the phone so I got up to answer it. He was like ""do you have to answer it now? Can't you wait until we are done?"" I told him I had to leave and got dressed. When I said bye to him I just gave him a quick hug and he leaned down to kiss me but I walked away. We usually kiss when greeting and saying goodbye to each other. I really like him a lot but I just feel like I ruined everything.

test_pid_1563,"Everything costs something : I realised something the other day that I thought might make sense to other depressed people. What mentally and physically healthy people don't understand,  is that everything,  *absolutely everything,*  costs something.  
They say it's easy. It should be simple.  You get up in the morning,  take a shower,  brush your teeth and go to work.  But what they don't realise is that these things they find so easy?  That's because they have an advantage we don't. They have energy.  
When you're depressed,  miniscule things that you wouldn't even think to attribute a 'cost' to, are huge. It might only take a very small amount of energy for regular people to do these things,  but some days,  it costs me all of my energy to take a shower or complete an assignment.  
And then there's money.  They all make it sound so simple. Go to therapy,  or get a prescription for antidepressants.  But what if I can't afford therapy?  'Then find a subsidised support service' they'll say.  There's always options,  for normal people.  But what if the only way I could see a cheap therapist is if I can financially, emotionally and physically afford to travel an hour there and an hour back by public transport? 
There's always a cost.  It may sound like excuses to normal people,  but when you're literally crippled by your mental illness,  there's really not a lot of options.  It's not just a 'low mood'. My mental illness has cost me everything,  and it makes me bargain every day.  I have to choose between changing my sheets and going to school because I can't 'energetically' afford to do both.
I can't negotiate with my brain like a bank.  I can't get what I want here.  Asking your brain to regulate ita chemicals when you're ill is like asking a bank for a mortgage when you have no income.  There's a price,  that I can't afford to pay.

I’ve been adding and adding to it cause I just don’t know what else to do anymore... :  My stress level have been through the roof this past month and I’m not in a good fucking place. Right now I’m needing to focus on shit in my life that definitely needs some improvement. Everyday I’m fucking waking up and I feel like I’m drowning in my own pit of self sorrow and self demise. Shit that should be making my life better turns it into this fire ball from hell trying to burn me alive. I try and try again to make the feeling subside and look for a better fucking light but god damn if that light does not dim then fade away at the end of the god damn day due to something I have no fucking control over. When you guys ask me what’s going on I want to talk about it damnit. I want to scream, yell, and shout about it but all I can fucking say is I’m fine, Or I’m good, or I’m alright. I sit there some days and wonder to my self if I should walk away or keep trying harder. I know my depression has gotten worse due to me losing weight. My eating habits have changed. I’m sleeping way more then usual and waking up with still no energy. When people ask what happen/ what hurt you. My own fucking expectations did. I thrive to be this great person and to be great at all these things but at the end of the day I’m none of the things I set out to be. I’m getting worse and no one knows it. Everyday I have to put on this fake smile while heading to work or at the very slim times that I hang out with friends because it’s always an endless excuse of there too busy or already doing something else. I’m too afraid to ask for help. I feel like as a man it’s frowned apon to ask for help and I don’t know what to do..  I go from work to home. Sleep for 15+ hours because at least when I’m asleep I can’t feel the sadness and burn that is enveloping me on a day to day basis.

I often go on about how I hate liars, how they often will get my hopes up for something just to find out that it wasn't true. 
You're attractive, I'm sure you'll find someone who will treat you right. 
If you prayed more and were closer to God you wouldn't feel this way.
Prayer and my beliefs are the only reason I'm still alive, but it doesn't change the fact that I have no will to live at all. 
I don't blame God for what goes through my head; I'm not angry at him. I'm past that. 
I was accepted to a college that I've wanted to go to for years yesterday.
This is the worst I've felt in years.
I hope I don't wake up tomorrow morning. I just want to be gone from here. There is no one I can trust, it never helps. I can get plenty more friends but this loneliness will never leave me. I won't ever find someone that would love me because I don't think I could bring myself to trust them, let alone try to speak to them. I act like nothing phases me, people see me as an intimidating silent type of guy who couldn't possibly take offense to anything. But when I see myself in the mirror, I see a scared little boy getting kicked on the playground. I see a fatass getting toyed with and then rejected. I see something hideous that could never be fixed or covered up. The reality is, I'm silent because I'm scared of speaking. I hate my voice. I regret everything I say, I'll probably regret typing this post. I don't want to insult anyone or hurt anyone with my words by saying the wrong thing, so I try not to say anything at all. But then I slowly forget, I slowly get complacent and build up confidence until I say something that once again, I come to regret. And each time it happens, I hate myself just a little bit more. 
It would seem that I have spiraled a bit into a wall of text
Remember how I said I hate liars? With how often I lie to myself, I'm the biggest liar I know.

I am a very social person at heart and love talking to people. As a kid and teen I always had heaps of friends and did stuff all throughout the week with small and large groups. I'm 21 now and it seems no one is interested in me anymore as a friend. I talk to whoever I can and I'm kind, respectful, try to be funny and easy going but it's like no one cares. I can initially make friends but then they start to never reply to text and always cancel plans or not want to do anything in the first place. I don't know if I have something wrong with me or if people are just like this around that age group. I have pretty bad depression but u wouldn't know unless I told you. I always try to be the happiest person in the room. 
I just want people to care about me and make a little effort to do something fun once in a while.

Just the thought of still being alive in 5 years has made me cry myself to sleep for the past week. The only things I have to live for are short term and I’m so tired. Despite my overwhelming sadness about living, I don’t think I could never find the courage to kill myself. I’ve just been hoping that something happens to me. Like I get sick or get into an accident or murdered or something. 
I’m not sure how to talk to anyone about this. I know that no matter who I talk to, they will react in an unnecessarily extreme manner. I could talk to my therapist, but it’s her job to take stuff like this super seriously. I could try my friends, but they would probably end up talking to my family about it out of fear. I don’t want to kill myself, but I feel that there isn’t a way to convince people that I mean it, so they would react like I would. I don’t know what to do or where to turn.

I feel like no matter what I do I will always be a failure. 
My life really isn’t that bad and that’s why I feel and sound so pathetic saying all this because I have no reason to feel the ways that I do. But I do and I can’t stop it. It’s just getting worse and worse as time goes on and I don’t know what to do. I would never take my life away I know it would hurt the people around me.

I'm at the point where I'm tired of asking ""why me"" and trying my best to turn it into ""why not me"" (corny but this mantra has been helping me). I really need to just get it all out of my head, fuck. And perhaps stop living and ruminating there too. 
I've isolated myself from everyone and I mean e v e r y o n e . I tend to do this, even as a child, I remember scraping my knee and running away to hide in fear of my mom seeing me hurt.

My parents are fine and there’s nothing inherently wrong with telling them but I’m not sure I was ready for them to know and I felt like she just kind of rushed me into it and I wasn’t really prepared: she didn’t give me any time to process and called as soon as I left the room. Also she basically said that because I couldn’t find any concrete reasons why I didn’t want to tell them I shouldn’t be scared to and it was the right thing to do.

I sit at home all day miserable. The degree hasn’t paid off financially due to a board of medicine exam (happening tomorrow actually.) I take my daughter to school and get her in the afternoon but I have no money or car to go and do anything we used to do together (what she wants to do.) Not to mention I’m so depressed I don’t know and to even wake up. I actually hope that I don’t wake up everyday. 
My SO keeps having success and progression towards his goals and dreams and brings it up all the time )I know he wants me to be happy and see that things will change) but I feel like a dagger goes through my heart each time while my resentment increases by 200%. I feel like I can’t celebrate all these things everyday, over and over like he wants when I don’t want to even exist.

I try to be the nice guy, but no matter what I'm never good enough for people. I tried not caring about what people think about me, like ""who cares about what they think I'm my own person."" But deep down it hurts that the fact that no matter what I'm the black sheep in the world. I don't want to live anymore and suffer for people's amusement. I try to make others happy no matter what, but no one cares about me. I lost all my friends. I most of my stuff, and when I say most I mean I have 4 things from all the stuff I had. I tried to fall in love, but only fell for grievance. I have no will to live anymore. Its the same as last year but worse. If I were to completely decide that I'ma end it once and for all I want everyone to feel like how I do right now(not family). Cause I try not to hide my emotions and literally no one cared.

test_pid_1585,"I Don't Belong : I have autism, so processing and communicating is extremely difficult for me. I've always been ""the quiet guy"" since elementary school and I remember on the first day of kindergarten that I was begging my mom to take me home. I have never been happy anywhere except on a baseball field or in my bed. No one would talk to me in school except for one friend, who was my best friend, but I was just another one of his friends. High school was when he stopped wanting to hang out with me, but we were still friends in school. One time in class, he was talking about a fishing trip he was going on with his dad and his other friend when our teacher asked him why he didn't invite me. He said that he knew I wouldn't want to go, but he never asked if I did (and he knew I used to frequently go fishing). That was when I realized I wasn't really wanted. I stopped interacting with people completely and spent all my time in my room, away from everyone. 
My senior year, I took online classes to graduate so I didn't have to go to school. That was when I isolated myself for about 4 years, and sometimes wouldn't leave the house for months at a time. I enrolled in community college and transferred to university after serious pressure and because I was seriously worthless. Still, no one wants anything to do with me. Everyone is in their own group and they don't want anyone else (well, they don't want me). I made the mistake of trying Tinder and haven't matched with anyone despite getting over 40 likes. I know I'm not unattractive, but not a single person wanting anything to do with me just makes me feel undesirable, unwanted, and unloved. I don't see this changing because I don't have any qualities or anything of value to offer anyone and I can barely handle a conversation. 
I just wish I wasn't born. I'm a waste of space and a resource drain. I've made plans to kill myself and I've written the note, so I guess this is it. I don't expect anyone to read this and I'm not sure why I wrote it. I'm glad I won't have to be unhappy and miserable anymore.",1

Bit of backstory about me, I’ve had depressive thoughts since I was in Primary School. I was about 9 or 10 years old when I started fantasising about dying and around 12 when I first had suicidal thoughts. I’ve had distorted eating and more severe eating disorder issues since I was around the same age. 
Now, I’m 22 and I’m still not happy. I met a girl the other day who said “Your the happiest person I’ve ever met!” and all I could think was how absolutely miserable I was. I just don’t come across as depressed. I’m always the life of the party, I’m the friendliest most outgoing person and I’m always drinking and having fun.
I drink to numb my thoughts and forget about my life, I have had hundreds of sexual partners and countless questionable sexual encounters because it’s a distraction. Since I was 17 I’ve just been drinking and fucking to forget and to try and move on. 
None of this really makes sense and I didn’t really explain anything but I guess the point is don’t think you know someone by how they act. Depression is a horrible thing and it effects everyone differently, some people just mask it better then others.",1

I started cutting myself maybe once a week but it has grown to almost every night now, I find it hard to get joy from things that I once loved, most of the joy I bring from the day is sitting in the bath cutting my upper thighs as to not show any cuts and bother anyone with this, or seem as thought I want attention. I try to distract myself as much as I can, body boarding, riding biking for long periods.

My whole life has been a complete disaster filled with tragedy, ruin, loneliness and heartache. I often consider than I've committed great sins in a past life and am paying the price for it. Superstitious dribble most likely, yet I have to believe there's a reason for this rotten existence I lead. 
I was born into a terrible family, where my earliest memories are an elder sister wishing me dead &amp; my parents arguing with constant tension. We had no family friends, we had no outside family (beyond immediate) none of my family appeared to have friends, and both my mother and father were social outcasts. My days were spent entirely alone, with my father ignoring me mostly, my mother at work, and my sister hating on me constantly. I first considered suicide when I was 9 years old, as I dreaded going home, I never had friends and was considered 'weird' and avoided since day one. As my parents both fought constantly, slept in seperate beds &amp; offloaded there woes to me, I've developed a complete fear of social interaction. I avoided and froze around girls, and have never had a decent friend or relationship. To this day, at 23 years old, I've never been on a date, never had a girlfriend, never invited to a party, never hung out with friends at a pub, never even really had a friend. No matter the social situation, no matter the setting, no matter the people, I'm considered weird and vastly disliked. No one wants to talk to me let alone touch me, as if I'm infectious or that I'm some serial killer or something. I'm treated as a monster and despised by everyone I've ever met. People will purposefully sit away from me, they'll stare at times (usually because I'm so ugly) &amp; quite frequently I'll get abuse and/or rubbish hurled at me from passing cars. I've been in rooms where someone will greet and introduce themselves to everyone in the room, and skip shaking my hand or ignore me entirely. Its been that way for as long as my memory goes. I'm completely invisible, and was nicknamed 'Mute' during late high school as I never spoke and never expressed myself. I learned not to. 
Confidence and happiness are things I'll never truly understand. I'm littered with moles and freckles all over my body and face which I can do nothing about. As a child I begged my mother to see if I could get them removed, as I had moles bleeding, she promised but nothing ever progressed. Throughout early teens I had the most horrendous pain in my right leg, which no matter how much I cried and complained was brushed off as 'growing pains.' Eventually it was discovered I had a tumour there, when the doctor recommended getting it removed I was relieved, yet we never saw the doctor again. Nothing ever happened &amp; I continue with the pain to this day. By this time I was taught to shut my mouth, and learned that complaining or talking about my issues led nowhere. Suffer in silence was the lesson instilled in me, and I've suffered in silence ever since. Add to this some awful dentistry and large bottom lip which means I can't close my mouth or speak properly, I can understand why girls would avoid me. I am one of the ugliest men on the planet. Of this I'm certain off. I've heard the term 'ew' to many times to count. 
I flunked education as I couldn't focus and never made friends. Even UNI is failing because I can't bear to go and be seen in public. The humiliation, the hatred towards me, the isolation. Its something I just couldn't bear. I was even drinking hard spirits in the parking lot trying to remove the anxiety before stepping out the car. Sometimes I can't even leave the car, the anxiety and shame is too much and I end up driving home. I'm still living at home, I have no money, no car and my dead-end job is enough to pay for cigarettes. My sister is diagnosed as schizophrenic, she screams to herself and stays in the house all day. She has hated me my entire life, and I don't believe she has said a word to me in 3 years.  She once (unprovoked) jabbed my eye so hard my vision is still impaired, and I have slight lazy eye because of it. My father I'm certain has some type of mental illness, he sits in front of the computer all day smoking, ignoring me as he has done most his life. My mother is only slightly sane, but leaves the house at every opportunity, its probably for the best, her constant disappointment and shame for her kids is most likely heartbreaking. Yet none of them know how I'm faring or whats going on in my life. 
I've thought of suicide for over a decade, and despite me holding on, despite me believing it may get better, despite trying to be a good person and giving all I have to people, my life is still a train wreck. Others may be depressed yet they often have a GF/BF, or a friend, or a degree or even a family to talk to. I have nothing, I don't believe I've had physical contact since I was 8 years old. I don't even know what a friend would feel like. No one has called my phone for 5 years. It's a Saturday night, and I'm crying into a whiskey bottle while smoking my last cigarette. 
I've tried therapy, but I often get the same response from them as I do from everyone else. One didn't even return my calls, another moved practice and won't answer my emails. I could go on and on for days about the misfortune I've suffered, and events and details which would make most people think they're watching a horror movie. I want to die, I want to die so badly it hurts. Every waking hour of my life is filled with both physical pain and Mental anguish. Its slowly and slowly getting worse, and I really fear for the future. I have achieved absolutely nothing in my life. I've never even been in a photograph. I may as well not exist, it would be better for society &amp; better for me. I'm starting to avoid light, I close myself of and feel fear even if I see an oncoming car as I'm conditioned to receive nothing but abuse and bad vibes. 
Honestly I apologise to anyone who's read this, I just needed somewhere to vent. I can't go on like this much longer, to be at the very bottom of every social ladder, to have nothing and no one, to see others my age thrive and embrace their youth, while I'm slowly ageing with no one at my side. 
I hope that anyone reading this has had a smile, maybe a hug, maybe even a laugh with a friend. Because I've never had that, and have forgotten how to smile or how to be happy. Its just darkness, and its getting darker.
I could have summed this all up with the immortal words of Freddie Mercury; 'I don't want to die, sometimes wish I was never born at all'",1
test_pid_1616,"Does anyone feel like they self sabotage to make their life match how they feel? : I used to ostensibly have a good life: decent job, relationship, good circle of friends. But I still felt shit. I feel I've slowly sabotaged all of those things so now I earn minimum wage, am single and live with my parents. It's shit but at least it aligns with how I feel a lot of the time. I'd like to work towards getting those good things on life again, but I'm sort of worried it would feel inauthentic. Anyone share this sort of feeling?",1
test_pid_1617,"I'm starting to lose all motivation... or I already have. : It's been a short while ever since I turned 18. I've always been an optimistic girl though I've endured some emotional abuse from my family and dad (degradation, humiliation and one incident where my dad got physical with me) and lost someone that I loved with all my heart at the age of 15. I still felt like everything will work out for me no matter what. As I turned 16 I learned to deal with my anxiety and I felt like I'm starting to finally have more control over my mind.. I thought I'll get better at school but now I don't see any ray of hope anymore.
I have some really important exams going on right now but I'm not able to do well. Every time I sit down and look at my books I start to panic. Something happened recently which really shook me up and ever since then I think I'm depressed because it makes me think some passive suicidal thoughts. My passion is writing poetry and I can't even seem to be doing that. I'm in love with somebody I can't have, who's countries away from me. I've developed seperation anxiety with him because I keep feeling like he'll meet the same fate as that person did who I lost at the age of 15.
I could always find a way to look the other way and think differently which made me feel okay and made me move on. Now everyday I just feel sick. I feel like I've passed away and I'm living in someone else's body, with the same memories.
I regret falling in love with him and I regret not pushing myself out of my comfort zone earlier on. I had the brains to but I was too busy painting, writing, and being addicted to YouTube.
I am aware that worrying is like a rocking chair, it gets you nowhere. I am aware that I am way too young to give up but I still feel like I am running out of time every second, and it still doesn't stop me from being lazy.
I don't know what I'm asking for when I post this on here. All my life I have been told that my problems are nothing because I'm a privileged child who's dad has a lot of money. I've literally been told that all of my f***ing life.",1

test_pid_1622,"Whats the point in living if no one cares about you being there or not : So a few days ago, I started to feel really lonely and basically became really jealous on the others at school because they seemed to be waaaay happier than me(14 year old male). I have no friends, no one ever said hi to me in around 3 years. However, that still is not the sad part. I decided to put a story on Instagram(already seems like a bad idea probably)where I put a pic of a suicide note written by me and you could easily tell it was written by me because I had a few parts mentioning my name and the town I live in. A week passed and NO ONE. Literally NO ONE bothered to talk to me or even look at me.
The story has 30 views and most of them are from people from my school. At first I was not really sad or anything on the situation, I was mostly disappointed because of how people just forget to be humans and all that. Everyone is too busy posting pics to show how cool they are but if someone actually has a mental illness no one cares. Another week passed and I start to realize how much of a sad fuck I am. Now you are probably wondering ""Dont u have parents?"" Well my father died a couple of years ago and my mom is busy finding happiness again with her crazy pervert boyfriend. I've tried speaking to her a few times, I even tried speaking with her boyfriend but they seem to be too caught up with their own existential problems to see me.

""Its a part of life"" or ""its normal"". I am diagnosed with depression 2 personality disorders and several traits of several other things. But whenever i go to explain my feelings to someone without explicitly telling them i have these things they presume its all ""normal"" its intensely infuriating and just makes me feel worse. Normalizing these horrible feelings can have some really bad affects on people. So before you presume what someone is feeling is normal. Listen to them. Maybe ask if it affects there life in any way. And ask them if they think these feelings and actions are abnormal. You really could stop a whole load of emotional pain by just asking these 3 questions.",1

We are cattle forced to graze so that oligarchs and plutocrats can get richer than they already are. 
I’ve been looking a lot into legal voluntary euthanasia the last few months. I don’t even feel that my life is particularly bad but I feel the only control I really have is in removing myself from the machine that bloodies so many others. 
Wondering if anyone else has considered making one last trip to a country where it’s legal to make the final journey?
The cost is usually prohibitive, especially when many of the cause of the feeling that be traced back to the lack of money.

test_pid_1628,"I feel like going down in a pitch black hole : I'm 23 years old and male. 
4 months ago I broke up with my girlfriend, that I had for six years. For the last two years she was struggling with major anxiety issues and a depression and I supported her as much as I could, completely ignoring my own problems. She did see two therapists but both of them sucked at their job and only made it worse. In the end I couldn't take it anymore because I started to be depressed myself and she gave me so much shit about me not caring for her although I did my best for her.
After the break up everything got worse. She proceeded to telling me that I'm a worthless piece of shit but in the same text she says that she loves me so much, that I'm the best that ever happended to her and she wants me back. She had to go to mental health care centers and even was in the Hospital because she collapsed at the day of the break up. I'm so ashamed that I done this to her but I could not make anything different for my own sake. Everyday she wrote me a text I was happy because it meant she didn't kill herself. This went on for three months and I just didn't know what to do spiraling down into hating myself, concentrating on my failures in studying, my bad body shape, money problems and everything else that I don't like in my life. So fast forward to last Tuesday where I met a girl and we made out. Turns out she had to leave today to another country so I did everything to see her a last time before that because she made me feel worth something for the first time in months. We had a Date yesterday, it was fun und we even had Sex although that wasn't planned. I really felt happy til today at 12. Suddenly everything came back even harder than before. Like I pulled a rubber band and it snapped so hard back in my face. I have lots of friends I could talk to but I'm just too afraid. I am more concerned what others may think of me than how I feel. I just don't see the purpose anymore... Actually I don't even know if I ever had one. I wasted 4 years studying something I didn't want to and in the end I had to quit. There is nothing I really burn for, nothing I want to do in my life. It's the first time that I realise this, but I have been like this since I can remember. Just surpressing everything that could bother me or trigger bad emotions and let it rest in me for eternity.
On the one hand I want to see a therapist and talk about everything on the other hand I'm too afraid to talk or see what's behind my mask that not even I can look behind because it's been too long since I layed it off.
Thanks for reading dear stranger. Just writing this eased the pain a little",1

test_pid_1630,"Both me and my best friend suffer from depression but I’ve recently realized that more people care for him than me. : Throw away account. Me (m23) and my friend let’s call him Kit (m24) met in high school and really didn’t start to hangout until senior year. We had a similar upbringing and problems we were both overweight and both had troubles with Bullying as kids and both came from pretty poor backgrounds. There are some major differences in childhood that we had but that’s not important. The gist is that we both care for each other and are good friend but we handle our problem differently. He took to the booze while I stay away from it due to family history, he is much more open with his illness, while I tend to be quiet about it. He was the brooding kid in high school I was the class joke. So naturally people started to give him attention. This bothered me for a long time and warped my perception of what it means to suffer from depression. I started to feel like maybe nothing was wrong with me and I was being a asshole. But as time went on and we got older he graduated and lost most of his weight, lost his virginity, and he has made more friends and is a very sociable he’s doing well for himself and I’m proud of him. He still post online about his depression and talks extensively about killing himself though. I unfortunately gained more weight, Im not sociable anymore. Don’t get me wrong I can be but I tend not to and he is still my only close friend. I’ve been coming to terms with myself as I want to lose weight, I want to find love, and I want to be more social. I‘m starting to come to terms with my sexuality (I realized I’m Bi I have an attraction to men and women), I realized what I want to do with my life, and I realized I don’t want to be this way anymore and I want to make changes to my life. Well anyways I started making these moves toward my betterment and it’s made me have to make decision for my own sake. I recently made a decision not to move in with Kit. We planned on doing after university and I told him that after I move out of my moms place I wanted to sort of get a fresh start and figure out who I am. I haven’t come out to my friend or family just yet I’m still in the process of accepting myself and I feel that I can’t do that with other people preconceptions of me. I needed a break in the status quo. I’m not ending my friendship with my friend I just need a change. My friend being the great dude he is understood and took it well however everyone of his friend and some of his family did not. They thought I was being selfish, and breaking a promise. They believe that I am abandoning him and that he needed his close friend to help him over come his problems. Even my own mother said what I was doing isn’t fair to him. It made me realize how my feelings didn’t matter. It made me break my diet, it made me contemplate suicide and it made me realize I could never tell these people how I feel because they would think I’m making excuses or jumping on a band wagon with my friend. When people see my friend they see someone who has been suffering from depression since high school and when people see me they see that dumb class clown who didn’t have a care in the world. I hate it here. I don’t want to be here anymore. 
I want to clarify that I’m not angry or jealous of Kit. I’m glad he lost weight and I’m glad he doing better. I just feel that because he has been open about his problems for years I feel that if I brought up mine his will dwarf my problems. I feel like I’m not allowed to feel the way I feel or that I’m too late and should’ve said something earlier. Sorry for the long post had to get this off my chest. Thank you for reading.

test_pid_1631,"Anyone successfully getting their life in order who can offer some advice? : I suffered from mental illness for a long time, which caused me to forfeit a lot of opportunities in my life. I went to school, dropped out, racked up debt, ruined my credit, and I am feeling over all hopeless.  
I lost all contact with any and all friends I have, gained a lot of weight during my binge phase (I was afraid to eat in front of people, and would wait until 2:00AM and just gorge myself.) , and am just withering away in my room.  
I stayed in my room for 5 years.  
I want to go back to school, but have no money for it, and I am having extreme difficulty finding/holding a job.  
I want to ask my father for help, but because of his beliefs my illness has gone untreated for a very long time despite multiple diagnosis'. I'm 25, about to be 26. I don't even have my driver's license.  
I'm feeling quite hopeless.
I don't have an aim or goal in my life because for the past 6 years (I graduated high school at 19)  
I have just spent every day mistreating myself and my body hoping I would pass in my sleep.
Now lately I've been waking up and wanting to give myself a chance. I've been waking up and wondering what if?  
I have no idea what I want to do with my life, and I am looking for jobs but I am just so scared to put myself out there. I am so scared to try, but I am getting so sad not trying.  
**Diagnosis:**  
I was originally diagnosed with (at 15) Clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder and delusional disorder and anorexia.  
Was re diagnosed at 18 with Clinical Depression, social anxiety disorder and delusional disorder.  
Was re diagnosed at 19 with Clinical Depression, general anxiety disorder and delusional disorder.  
These were times I was taken to the hospital and forced to stay on a form.  
I now (Past year, 25 years of age) am diagnosed with Manic-Depressive Disorder, Bulimia Nervosa, SAD, and BDD.
I don't have money to get medications, and I am very afraid to get help from my father. I have failed so many time in the past that even thinking of asking for help makes me feel really ashamed.  
I try to talk to him to get perspective, or offer up ideas about my life and what I should do but he always says he doesn't want to hear anything from me, and only wants to see progress.  
It's only gotten worse since he had a child with his new wife. So he is investing his parenting her the baby.  
I'm okay with that. I realise I am an adult, but I feel like I never grew up and I'm trapped in this prison which is my own skin. . . my own mind.  
I have also taken advantage of the social system in my country in the past before. I am afraid to return there to ask for help, and most days I am afraid to leave my house anyways.  
I reached out to my mother. She is JUST LIKE ME. That makes me so sad.
I do a lot of research and am working on a lot of changes, which usually last in 3 days on, 4 days off, but I am working on will power.
1. Eat when I am hungry. Yes, I find myself restricting, but it stops me from bingeing and purging at night.
2. Drink water. I used to not drink water until I would faint. Now I am up to 6 cups a day.
3. Shower every day. This one is hard, a lot of people might find this hard, but it is so hard to even have a desire to take care of myself.
4. Walking every day. I got a dog. I feel guilty when she doesn't get to go outside. I don't walk her every day, but I do give her free roam of our spacious backyard. She was the kick start/ catalyst to me taking care of myself, because I had to take care of her.
5. Cleaning a little every day. My living space (my bedroom) is atrocious. I make efforts to cleaning a little day by day.
6. I use this website and sometimes I can make money on it (about $10 every 2 weeks) and I am saving up for transportation (the bus fare) and medication.
I learned about habit building, eating healthy and exercise.  
**I feel like all of these things are first steps, but I relapse after a few days without fail.**  
I laid out all of the above because it is where I am coming from and my current situation.  
I want to get a job, pay off my debt, and go to school.  
I want to get married, and have kids.  
I want to be able to drive, and go out with friends and do something fun. I never had that, even as a child.  
Does anyone have any advice for me? Anything at all? I have no direction in my life.
TLDR: Suffered from mental illness and feel like I am behind in life. I just want some general advice as to where I should start/go from here.",1

I've recently had some bad months, really bad, to such a degree that it affected my body, I've had daily headaches and insomnia(which I still have, but I'm treating). Well, I dealed with this depression cloud hanging over me for a long time, I had the feeling of hopelessness and everything but still could function properly as to not treat it. As I said, recent events drove me to seek medical help, I've started Lexapro and been taking Xanax for the insomnia, as well as started therapy. Amazing right? The medication will somehow work in my brain and I'll no longer feel this clutch in my heart and darkness inside. Right? Well, after some deep reflections and seeing people's experience(I know many of you have been dealing with this illness for most of your lives) I just accepted what I've known for some time: yes, the medication may help to ease the feeling and get me through it but I don't think I'll ever be genuinely happy. In my particular case the depression is just the result of this repressed, frustrated life I've built for myself and unless some magical event happens I don't think I have much chance of changing it. How many of you experience the same thing? I know in some cases the depression is merely a chemical imbalance that aren't a result of frustration, but what about those who have been made depressed by... life? How do you guys feel about it?

test_pid_1635,"A better day (happy) : I was quite depressed from unwhelming work ethic and accomplishment  and overwhelming work last week. It got so bad I told myself many things subconsciously and paid the price to go to a therapist. Although I thought I was strong enough to give it some time and think it would get better, It definitely helped me get perspective. Therapy isn't a quick fix but it does speed up the process of progress and feeling better! 
(I've also been in times sad so much as that I think I almost enjoy it- such as being lonely-sad and wondering as to why I haven't had a long term relationship yet, but that's for another time) 
How bad it was: I was very behind on my courses and after coming home from them would just collapse- sad-crying and hopeless. I got really distant from everyone and felt useless overall. I thought college wasnt right for me and that I never really ever had a good work ethic or goals in mind to accomplish anything. I told my parents and they both got very helicopter-y which was fair. I just needed to talk and sought out help multiple times, often indecisive until I built up courage. I wasnt thinking straight. I failed an exam because I TOLD myself I couldn't do it as in i knew more than I wrote down when I should've tried to get it postponed on the basis of (mental) illness (if that would work). It was bad. 
How I recovered: I focused on myself.  I mediated daily sometimes more. I started working on my body at the gym more. I became more outgoing and told atleast 2 close friends /family what was going on. 
And  I also sat down to study for my next exam alot, went to the library for the majority of the week. I would start by meditating and then sometimes with breaks-a short walk or  meditating again. 
I am set on going to the museum today with some classmates and going to a hangout with friends later.

test_pid_1636,"Failed suicide attempts and the aftermath : In october of last year, i overdosed and had a wonderful time breaking my nose and having seizures. i tried to kill myself again after that, and i’ve been in a residential treatment center since then. BUT!!!! I’ve now been sober for four months, and so far I’ve been accepted into 2 colleges! I got my ACT test score back too—I got a 31. Things are actually improving a lot, and i’m really happy with where i am now. i never expected to live up to this point, but i did and i’m doing much better than i ever thought i would.",1
test_pid_1637,"I should technically be happy : Let me start off by saying that I consider myself to be a very lucky person. Nothing to do with depression, but rather with the opportunities and quality of life for the very little effort I have put into it. I have a job I'm ok with even though I'm a drop-out, still young, physically healthy, without debts, etc. I never take a single day for granted because I've been around the worst periods of my life and know that it could be so much worse. 
I've done my fair share of misery. Plagued with suicidal thoughts, hate, envy, heartbreak, tantrums, breakdowns and feelings of isolation and worthlessness for years that's left a complete void in my soul. It's relatively better today, but it's time lost I will never get back. I have accomplished absolutely fuck-all in the last 15 years, gaining close to zero life experiences or friendships. I take full responsibility for it as I've had all the opportunities to do make it different. My biggest problem is that I've been too much of a coward my whole life.
I think I finally reached the critical point where strong emotions have no effect on me, this goes for all feelings. I'm not as angry for instance because there is no logical conclusion that would make me feel better. I lack the energy to bother. You can only cry yourself to sleep so many times until it becomes mundane. It feels like my body and mind are in limbo. Everyone and everything just matters less overall now , people and family included. My focus is mostly on work because at least I get to feel appreciated.
I have been down this road too many times to not even bother any more, I mostly just repress it all and put on my invisible rose-tinted goggles. I'm not old, but I feel old. I've become boring and unmotivated to try and resolve. At some point, we must accept who we are, our faults and short-comings. I stopped talking about it, as I found it only served as a medium for rumination. It's harder though because of how much energy my job saps away from me and the complete lack of of trust I have in other people.
 My income feeds a degenerate dopamine junkie who lives on junk food, video games, porn and gambling. It's the only thing I can do without feeling utterly bored. However, even those things have come to feel entirely pointless and repetitive and I long for something with meaning. The price I pay is self-loathing. If I felt too weak, lazy and undisciplined before to change, depression just adds another mental layer of difficulty. My many attempts to change patterns have been very short-lived. It's disgusting just how disorganized I am and how little everything matters. How little motivation there is to even do simple tasks with perpetuates the cycle.",1
test_pid_1638,"I don't even know : This is going to be quite long so skip it if u want to. 
I've been feeling really out of it for the longest time - feeling lethargic, depleted and just so so tired. Every morning I have to physically drag myself out of bed and even talking or moving around is a chore for me. 
I don't know if this is depression or just me still suffering from my burn out from last year, where my little ""situation"" got worse -- to this point. (I was studying for my gce A levels and burnt out 3 months before the exam. Physically couldn't study or do anything at all) 
When I'm working or on the rare occasion that I'm out with friends, I'm usually the most bubbly and cheerful person, the person who cracks jokes and makes the most retarded comments, the person who's always full of life. But this little burst of energy will last for 15 minutes or so and then I just completely shut down. 
On the weekends or after I get back home from work, I isolate myself completely from my family, lock myself in my room and I don't communicate with anyone at all. I end up getting scolded by my parents for speaking so softly, moving so slowly, being so mechanic, laying in bed and doing absolutely nothing at all, being called dull and listening to the constant rants of ""why can't u just be brighter and happier?"" just because I simply don't have the energy to function. 
I've lost interest in almost everything I've enjoyed doing, I cannot be bothered to do anything at all, I just don't care about anything anymore. 
It's just getting worse day by day and I used to think that you know, one day I'll just get over it and be happy again. But that doesn't seem to be happening and I'm just sinking deeper and deeper and I'm afraid I'll lose control one day. 
I've never sought any form of help, let alone be clinically diagnosed. Most of the time I tell myself that I'm just a little bitch who can't handle hardships or that I don't even deserve to be depressed because honestly, what is there to complain about? Maybe this is not as dramatic as I think it is, it's just me overreacting to the dumbest shit ever and I'm just a privileged kid complaining about first world problems. 
I don't even know. I don't even know what I want. I just wanna isolate myself from the world, lie in my bed, listening to sad songs, self pitying and slowly rot away.

ever since i got back home, i've been feeling myself get progressively sadder and weaker to the point that it takes me two hours to start something i want to do, whether it's getting ready to go out, brush my teeth, or simply get up to use the restroom. my head has been spiraling nonstop and i can't take it anymore. last saturday was when everything actually began; i suddenly had vertigo and it was hard to even roll over in bed without being so overly anxious about everything, i went to the bathroom, gave a good look at myself, and just started to cry... i don't know what happened after that, all i remember was going to bed and waking up in the middle of the night because my dream was too sad and depressing for me to want to continue having it.
the morning after and every other morning since have all been shit. i can't focus on anything, eating is as hard of a task as it would be to deadlift 200 lbs right now, everything i do has just been so draining, and i can see the sadness and the desperation on my face... i'm questioning everything and everyone and it sucks that i feel as if i have no one because my own boyfriend isn't being supportive or understanding and my other two friends are too busy for me to want to bother them... we're not that close anyways... i've been relying on my mom for everything, i've already bawled my eyes out to her three times in just one week and i don't think i can do it again, i need help... i need something to help me feel human again because right now, i feel alienated from everything. shit, i can't even watch a movie normally, i can't watch funny videos like a regular person, i know they're funny in my head but i can't even let out a chuckle... i don't know what's wrong with me and i hate not knowing. 
i'm ruining everything for myself. im not ready to go back to school yet, not after this, but i have to... i want to succeed. the only things keeping me alive right now are the fact that i finally know what i want to do with my life and that my birthday is coming up... everything else is falling appart for me. my happiness, the control i sort of had over my anxiety, even my own fucking relationship... i can't tae this any longer... i wanna skip all this so i can finally get to the happy part of my life... this sucks...",1

When I receive a text from a friend, I read it instantly and am excited by the message and think about all the things I am going to say, but then keep thinking about what I am going to say. Sometimes, I am hit by inspiration of what I feel is a great response, but I still don't reply. Weeks will go by and I will constantly think about how I need to respond to the texts, but never feel like it. Then, it another texts comes in from the person, I am afraid to read it because I know that I haven't responded yet and it will take me another few days just to work up the courage to read it. It may take me weeks or even a month or two to reply.
Most of my friends that I still have left write long texts that can take me an hour or two to respond to when I finally feel like responding. By that time, I feel kind of drained.

I wasn't better. I was still on xanax n codeine and loosing jobs left right n centre.

I've been suffering from depression + agression dissorder probably all my life, been suicidal since I was 15, have ptsd (due to being missdiagnosed with ADD when I was young, after that I thought through my whole childhood I've been seriously mentally dissabled).
I remember being sexually active pretty early (also with females) and despite my mental health I really enjoyed it.
At 15 until I was 16 I had a really abusive relationship (she was most likely a psychopath, I was been manic and had a serious drug problem which later resulted into psychosis throughout most of the relationsship). At the beginning sex with her was the best thing ever, but when my psychosis started and I stopped being manic, I didn't found any pleasure in sex anymore.
Since then, even three years later, I never loved someone again (not even a crush) and have been feeling completely asexual. I don't feel the desire and need to pursue a relationship anymore. And I'm too scared to have sex because of the embarrassment that I'm not in the mood.

test_pid_1662,"Finally get invited, but can't. : I have sat at home for 4 months. Had a baby on Halloween and it's been downhill ever since. And no, don't blame PPD. I have no job, no friends that actually care, and nothing to do but sit here. 
I have always been self sufficient. Paid my own way. I was raised to never need anyone, much less a man, to take care of me. In the spirit of that I always had high hopes for myself. I had dreams of finishing school and landing the perfect job so that I could teach my kids that hard work is worth it. I promised myself a long time ago that I would never settle when it came to work. If my kids would have to witness an unhappy mom due to her work, then I wouldn't work there. 
But now, it seems like that's my only option. Nobody wants to hire someone with 2 kids. Husband works 10-7 so I have to be the one picking up from school and daycare. No grandparents to do it in a regular basis. Everyone keeps saying, ""That's what happens when you have kids."" Fuck you if you think that. Just saying. I've made it very clear what I need and people offer suggestions that I told them wouldn't work. And my husband says, ""Quit being rude."" And ""Let me take care of things."" I'm not like that. I'm a straight shooter. I don't sugar coat things and I damn sure am not okay with someone else paying my way. 
To add to it, I literally have nobody. All of my so called friends from my younger days ditched me a long time ago because I got married and couldn't run wild with them anymore. I've been clinging to a virtual best friend for the last 4 years. I say virtual because we can't actually hang out together. I'm a chick, he is a dude, both married with kids, yet it's still inappropriate. So we text, messenger, and Snapchat. That's all I've had as far as a best friend for the last 4 years. 
And now, even that seems to be slipping away.  He works long days, has time with the family in the evenings and on weekends so that pretty much leaves no time to listen to me bitch. 
I literally feel like everyone around just sits there and runs their mouth about me. Sniggering behind my back and the looking at me with some stupid looks. Even happens at church get togethers. I don't even wanna go anywhere anymore. My sister called today. She never does. Actually invited me to her house next weekend for a pure romance party. I'm not going. I don't want to be around people, much less the uppity women she hangs out with. And when I tell her that I hear, ""What's going on? Is it PPD?"" 
I am so very tired of people thinking that. I've battled depression for over 15 years now. It has nothing to do with my hormones. 
I don't want to be here anymore. I've spent my entire adult life preaching to people about how suicide is wrong. I've lost 3 people that way. I'm the friggin poster child for anti-suicide.  So my question is, What about me? Where is my fucking support? Where are the people that claim they care? They listen to me once and then get so far out of reach they are non-existent. Like, I spend years listening to their problems and trying to help, but the one time I am in obvious pain and need them they were nowhere to be found.

They still treat me this way while on it as well. Medication isn't the cure or tool I need. I need support. Specifically a place where I'm alone and money isn't a problem. I work, I get ssi, and I used to volunteer, and could finish college any day now if I wasn't beaten every month. I cant leave my dads house. No group homes (because of rape) No room mates (Because everyone beats me and I want time away from that) No Full time job (Cant Handel it, I would explode at work at some point) No homelessness (Because my life has just been poverty so far, I would kill myself eventually).

test_pid_1678,"Therapeutic Venting : Depression is an awful way to spend a life and in some unfortunate cases can cause a life to be cut short. The scariest part about depression is that it can sneak up on anyone and affect the people who seem the least likely. I have been unlucky enough to experience the aftermath of someone taking the ultimate path to ending their depression, twice. Both times is came seemingly out of nowhere, completely blindsiding me at the time but looking back, I should have seen the signs and feel like I should have acted to prevent their decisions. This alone is a futile thought though, as when someone doesn’t want to be helped it’s always going to be hard to reach them. Both of them reassured me that they were doing well and I took them at their word, some may call it naivety, but I want to be able to trust people. Knowing what I know now of course, I would have acted, but hindsight will always be 20/20. In the grand scheme of things, how do I know that my words would have even altered their chosen path. I don’t believe in fate, but sometimes I do believe that a person who is feeling trapped in their mind will find a way to end their suffering one way or another. This is after all, just the ramblings of someone who is struggling with their own mind and is trying to type this out to take his mind off of all of the turmoil inside.
For some reason I have latched onto a poor girl and have laser focused my self worth behind what she thinks of me, more than likely driving her away. It is tough when you don’t feel like you’re in control of your emotions, seemingly spirally out of control without a moments notice. Feeling like you’re all okay when you are surrounded by people who care for you, but behind closed doors you still struggle to control yourself. There’s strange waves of exhaustion that hit where you feel like you could crash but as soon as you try and crash your mind begins swirling in thoughts and things that cause anxiety and stress. I was worried about things out of my control and I broke my old adage “control the controllables”, my coach had built this adage into my everyday life as I would sometimes lose control of my emotions when I played. He could see that I would hide behind a false bravado and would attempt to mask many of my insecurities with humour, constantly self-deprecating. He always made sure that I would repeat and focus on the adage and would hold myself accountable to the actions and emotions that I could control. I can’t control what other people think of me, but I need to control my own perception of myself. This girl has been more than understanding and has given me plenty of leeway of how insecure I am and has done her best to put my mind at ease, but I have always assumed the worst intentions of people when I get in these sort of funks and I think I have finally pushed her away enough.
The only reason that I’m even writing this is because I wasn’t able to sleep and hoped this would distract me from the fact that I’m awake at 4am. I’m so scared that people will think so much less of me because I have these struggles, usually I’m able to contain these on my own and put my brave face on when I feel it coming. But this time it was too much, it built up too quickly and I was unprepared for the emotions that would flood through me. It’s what made things so hard to control, I opened up to people that normally I would want to hide it from, I hate being perceived as weak, but I needed help. I had never really thought of suicide in a true way, but I have caught myself casually wishing that something on the outside would end it, maybe another car would take me out, a hit to the head, some sort of freak accident to spare my family the shame of me. Those thoughts scared me and caused me to open up to a couple people, I probably should have kept my mouth shut as it didn’t truly feel like it helped anything, it may have even exacerbated things because some of the actions seemed to go in the complete opposite direction of where I thought they would go. Then again, for all I know these negative thoughts have all just poisoned and pervaded into every other thought causing me to think the worst about peoples actions. 
And therein lies the problem of depression.. You begin to second guess your own thoughts because you know that you are being negative, but then you start to rationalise why that thought should be negative. It’s the never ending loop that has been playing in my mind. Then you start to second guess every interaction you have with people, wondering if they were being genuine or whether they’re just trying to placate you because they know you’re damaged goods. Which just feeds into the self loathing because you start to truly believe that you’re a burden on people and they are just looking forward to the moments away from you. If I send a message I wonder how it’s perceived, if they don’t respond I automatically assume that it’s an eye roll type situation even if it’s an innocent mistake of just forgetting to respond. This morphs into the worry that if you then message again you’re being pushy and can’t take a hint, so you end up checking up constantly and worrying that you’ve fucked everything up. It’s a nasty cycle that I have managed to perfect quite. I have always had the worry in my mind that I have some sort of social awkwardness or inability to truly socialise, always feel like I’m putting on a facade to make people like me. I think the whole reason that I have latched onto this girl is because I actually feel like I can be me around her and she hasn’t run for the hills as of yet, she can be quite selfish but I believe the selfishness is more to do with a lack of forethought than malice. But then I sound positive and I almost have to remind myself that she has preferred to spend her nights sleeping with another guy and even though they both have been upfront about it not being sexual, I can’t help but have those negative thoughts intrude and assume the worst. This feeds into why I believe that I have driven her away, surely she is sick of a neurotic, depressed individual pining after her and causing her undue discomfort with his brokenness. Especially after telling him that she isn’t into feelings and relationships and he carrying on almost as if he has some sort of say in what she gets to do.
Unfortunately the way that this depression managed to invade my mind so stealthily was because of an anniversary. Katrina took her life on the 3rd of February, but because of how our interactions had been going I assumed she had just gotten busy, so I got busy myself and managed to reach the pinnacle thus far of my career. So it was only on the 26th of February where I started to really worry that something was wrong, I looked her up and was ashamed to find out that she had passed away and I hadn’t even realised. Here I was celebrating myself and my achievements over text to her and her poor family were the ones who were probably receiving those messages in their grief. I was fortunately in a room to myself by this point and broke down, I felt so worthless that I hadn’t been able to get her to see how special that she was to me and everyone else around her. She felt lost and I couldn’t help her enough to find herself. The thing that hurt the most was seeing the date of her death and realising that I had been speaking to her the day before she made that fateful decision and knowing that she didn’t feel comfortable with me enough to share and tell me how much she was struggling. I guess that is one the reasons that I finally reached out to my parents on a particularly bad night; exhaustion and hunger exacerbating the swirling thoughts in my head causing me to finally crack. Katrina’s anniversary also made me reflect on the way that I found out about Luke, spoken to him in person less than a month before and he seemed so happy and relaxed. We spoke about the future and talked about how nice it will be for him to finally be able to relax without baseball and the worries of staying healthy. I had kept in contact with him while I was back in Australia and although he sometimes seemed a little bit off, he always reassured me that he was doing well, made headway on seeing his children and I got to see updated pictures of them. I went away on a softball clinic in a remote area and was having a really good time and had even messaged him about how it was such easy money to make because I was enjoying it. Then suddenly I have one of our mutual friends asking if I’d heard about Luke, almost instantly I felt a knot in my stomach and knew that he had taken his own life. My worst fears were unfortunately realised as I started trying to prove things wrong, I felt numb, my vision tunnelled and I felt a bit lost. The only saving grace for that period was how I was able to continue to do the clinics and the kids were able to keep my mind away from all the negative emotions. But I hadn’t dealt with them and thats where I went wrong, I pushed them to the side and just assumed that I would be able to talk about it down the track. But I never did, I didn’t want to, because it again felt like I should have had some part in preventing it and because I didn’t felt like I played a role in it. Anger at Luke also crept into my mind as he knew how hurt I was about Katrina as he was one of the people that I spoke to about her, he was one of my closest friends and he still took his own life. Some people say that it was probably to spare my feelings, which I do understand, but it doesn’t soften the blow. Obviously he couldn’t go on anymore, but I would’ve rather he flew to Australia and tried a fresh start here.
I guess that this actually been a bit therapeutic to me, I don’t even know why thought I’d write this out, I haven’t written this for any other reason than that I wanted to pass the time before I have to get up and try to go about my day productively. I was going to go for a run but I figured that wasn’t the brightest of ideas considering that I hadn’t eaten anything today and I’m supposed to play a game in the afternoon. Playing on 2 hours sleep is certainly going to be an experience, hopefully I don’t have any stupid breakdowns on the drive there. But I shouldn’t, I will just jam out to some music and try and push the bullshit to the bottom as I usually do. I’m so sick of this, I just want to be normal. I’ve now involved too many people and I feel shit as is anyway, so that’s fun. So many stupid as fuck decisions, but hey, that’s just what I do. I wonder if I will read back on this and laugh about how dumb this all seems.. I hope so. Maybe I can read this next year when I decide to go insane again and I can try and ground myself before I do all this dumb shit again. Fuck me, you’d think that I would have some sort of forethought and would stop being a drag to be around, no wonder you pushed people away and caused such an unnecessary amount of stress to people that don’t deserve that. You haven’t even called your best friend back and let him ring out twice, you’re lucky to have such an incredible friend and you take him for granted just because you’re feeling weak. You’re quite literally doing exactly what Luke and Katrina did to you to him, you can’t get mad about things if you don’t learn from their previous mistakes. Have some feel and talk to him, maybe you can give him a call tomorrow on the drive there. Will that reignite the turmoil or will that help quash it before you get out there? I guess you will have to find out. The trouble is that you’re supposed to try and socialise with people when you’re like this to distract yourself, but it’s hard when feel like you force people to be around you. I may even drop in and visit my friend tomorrow after the game, see if he wants to do dinner. I’m sure he won’t be too upset by it, but I don’t want to feel like I’m imposing and I’d feel shit if she was there because then it would just seem weird and creepy, not letting her enjoy her time with him. He’s certainly less of a wet blanket than you are currently..
The funny thing about this little essay that I’ve typed is that I was originally planning to try and create an actual story with random characters and see if I could use this as a creative outlet, but instead I’ve just typed out some of the negative thoughts and things I’ve done. Positively, it has caused me to get a little bit tired, although it is now nearing 5am, so it isn’t like if I sleep I will getting a worthwhile sleep anyway, so that’s fun.. This has also reminded me of my college days, getting up early or staying up late and pounding out an essay the best I can and somehow still hoping for a good mark even though it is more than likely a complete mess. I don’t even want to think about what a mess this whole thing is, guarantee that it’s full of plenty of errors and skipped words where my fingers can’t keep up with the brain and I get ahead of myself. If someone other than me ever reads this, I pity you and apologise in advance!",1

test_pid_1680,"Childhood Abuse ( TRIGGER WARNING ) : So I found out last night that I was sexually, physically and emotionally abused as a child ... I was emotionally and somewhat physically abused from 15-18. The sexual abuse stopped around 14 when I confronted my mom about it .
There were lots of little things like having a nap with my dad when he had just a towel on up until I was 13. I would have baths with my mom until I was 13, and other things I thought were normal. I also remember my cousin who's a year younger than me would make me touch her inappropriately and it would make me uncomfortable.

test_pid_1684,"Lonely as fuck. : What is the point of being alive in this world? Nothing is even worth it anymore. Why did I have to be born on this planet? I am too tired to deal with this at this point. I was basically crying myself to sleep last night. 
So yesterday I was with my homies in class and one thing led to another and we started talking about why I didn’t have a girlfriend and shit like that, and it later dawned on me. I never had a girl or anything like that. For starters, I’m 16. Almost everyone I know is already in a relationship, some get in many. I could just walk down the halls and see a whole bunch of people making out and shit, which it’s a high school, you’re gonna see shit like that every day. But it immediately gets me wondering; why can’t I get shit like that? What is it about myself that makes no one even care about me or love me at all? How hard is it for me to get such a thing that seems so easy for others to have? Like what, do these people just go up to random people and ask them out and there we go? It can’t be that easy, but everyone else makes it look like it is.
I did have many opportunities, that I utterly fucked up. There have been times when I either had girls had a crush on me, which I knew of, or were friends with a girl that I could have had a chance with. One was a girl I met at a softball practice. My nieces used to play softball all the time when they were younger, and used to go to practice, and I would go as well. I met this girl who I became friends with. However, I only saw her like once or twice, and never saw her again. There was also this girl I met at my niece’s birthday party, who admitted that she liked me, by writing “I love you, Chad” with chalk in the backyard. Now, my name isn’t Chad, just putting it out there, because that would be hilarious if it was, but no, people my whole life always fuck my name up for some reason. 
Those people I met MANY years ago, however, and I haven’t seen them since. 
However, there was this one girl that I knew when I was in eighth grade, that had a crush on me, who I’m not gonna name for obvious reasons. She would flirt with me all the time, and it basically became a joke with everyone. I could tell you many stories about this, but let’s just say it’s not family-friendly. I should’ve definitely taken that opportunity, but here’s the thing; I was incredibly different back then. If you knew me now, and compared how I was back then, I was a whole different person. I was incredibly shy back then, and every time she would flirt, for example; like one time she called me daddy in front of everyone, I would always blush and get awkward. That was the difference, now, I know for certain I would have handled that differently and way better than I did back then. I regret not doing anything about that at all. In the beginning, I doesn’t really like her at all, and thought she was just annoying, but something happened. After awhile, I started getting a crush on her as well, and it went from there. It was basically a huge sexual-awakening for me, and led to my big problem which I’ll get to soon. I remember I would basically fantasize about being in a relationship with her. Now, when I look back, it’s cringy as fuck. I handled that extremely wrong. Anyways, I remember one time she was mad at me because she thought I liked a girl that I was friends with, even though we were just friends. It’s actually kind of hilarious, now that I think about it. But yeah, I basically left eighth grade and went to high school, and she went somewhere else, so there’s that one I fucked up on. 
So, on to high school. I have a huge problem with having a crush on, well, basically every girl I see and know. Now, I know that shit is normal, but it’s a huge problem for me. It’s almost like I just think of girls as objects and not actual people. I could just look at basically every girl and fantasize about having sex with them. It’s just annoying at this point. I have some friends that are girls as well, and every single day I see them, I just imagine having sex with them. It’s excruciatingly annoying. I could have a chance with them, but here’s the thing; it’s all just a trap. I could get attached with a girl, and what do you know? They’re either in a relationship, or are lesbian. It’s almost like there’s no chance either way for me. Almost everyone in my school is in a relationship, or just simply don’t want me. I have done this many times, I tried what I could to be in a relationship with someone, and it turns out that it’s not going to happen. I have done this all the time, and I’m basically tired of it. It’s obvious I don’t care about them as people at all, I obviously don’t think of them as something other than objects. I just want my dick wet. I just want to smash, that’s all it is. I don’t deserve any of these people. I wonder why no one even cares about me at all, but now I know.
It’s all a joke, I’m just put here to be tortured. If there is a god(s), they obviously put me here as a joke, to laugh at me. It’s all obvious and adds up. They’ll do anything to make my existence terrible. I’m not meant for anything other than that. I don’t deserve this life, I just want out. I just want to feel like people actually care about me, but that way of living died with my childhood years ago. Ever since I left elementary, my life went downhill. Why can’t I go back to then?

I can't even write properly through the tears. Everything is so blurry. I'm scared. I want someone to hug me and tell me its going to be okay. But I dont know who I want because I dont know who actually will.
I've hit my lowest point in life. Nothing out of the ordinary even happened today but I was hit with a wave of self hatred and wondering why anyone actually wanted me around.

He got on top of me and got naked and I started screaming because her put a blade into my nipple. And it hurt really bad now I like taht tho I’m used to it. I like being cut but that was one of the first times it was so scary. And he slowly cut it down and I had to get stitches but I didn’t. And it hit infected and my boob hurt so bad. It hurt forever and the scars so big it’ll never go. And he I told him to stop and said he’s hurting EM and if he don’t stop I’ll kms and he said he don’t care. He said I’m just wasting my body it’s my fault I started it. I’m the one that’s hot I’m the one who’s a girl. I’m the one with the good body. It’s my fault.

I am preparing for MBA and i have two interviews lined up and i think this my last chance.
I literally don't know that what i am feeling is depression or not but i am finding it difficult to explain.
I don't have any problems in my life which are rare for the guy of my age.
Normal love matters, family issues, career issues.
I think for the first time in my life i am feeling restless and can't help it.
I think i don't know where is my life heading.
I don't know where to start and i am like lost.
I have friends, i have girls whom i flirt, i watch porn daily (things i used to love) , but i don't care about all of these things.
I get irritated easily.
I shout at my parents and then cry in my room silently.
I have never opened up with someone like this, online.
I feel empty inside like i don't know what i want to do..what gives my happiness.
I get sad very easily which is rare for me bcz being an extrovert.
I think people are ignoring me.
Ignoring my health, ignoring my messages, the people who used to love me are moving on.
Idk what can i do to let them know that i am sad and feeling so alone and lonely inside.

test_pid_1705,"So I just got home from going out for the first time in my life, and I felt disconnected and empty and felt like crying/fake the entire time. : So I didn’t thought I was depressed but I’m 21M and I have rly low self esteem, and I started a new job last October.
Today my coworkers had a “go out and eat and do some bowling” so I joined them, since I got no friends and it’s a good thing to go out and challenge my social anxiety.
I went, and they all laughed and had a good time. I felt so disconnected and lonely and empty the entire time. I had thoughts like “how can they think this is so fun” etc.
One of my coworkers when we did bowling, when I missed or did a bad go, or when I lost the round. She told me “aww, we playing for fun”, “nice try” etc. it just feels like she feel sorry for me and it sucks.
I been doubting my ability on my job lately as well, and on the way home I said something like “I wanna see if I get a full time job here, when my trial ends in September, before I move to x city” and one of them said very carefully “hopefully u get to stay” while, the rest was quite. A second before we talked about that, my other coworker in the backseat said she hopes she gets to stay, and all in the car agreed, and made sure she will.
What am I experiencing?",1
test_pid_1706,I just feel so empty : I thought i was finally getting better. But i think i might be at one of my lowest points. Everything just doesnt matter anymore. I cant even talk to anyone about it irl because ik that nobody would care. My life is just so pointless.,1
test_pid_1707,"Job loss and depression : Basically I was let go without warning a few weeks ago. I took some time and took a trip, filed for unemployment and escalated my case up and came to a mutual agreement that was positive with my company.
This experience has to say the least, wrecked me emotionally. I didn’t love my workplace but the income, benefits, and overall atmosphere was always enough. I poured myself into making this job and atmosphere better and at the end they just devalued and wiped it away in a phone call that was less than 10 minutes. 
I hit the ground running, sent out applications l I’ve sat interviews and just a few setbacks have me really depressed. I have a part time that’s helping me stay afloat and have been putting in apps like crazy but I feel so sad and anxious, especially today. I filed for unemployment so i was counting on that but now there’s a discrepancy that means they have to review and I’m terrified they’ll disqualify me for some reason which will mean I’ll be destitute almost until I find a new job I’ll know on Monday. 
How do you stay motivated through adversity such as job loss? What are some good tricks and tips to try? I keep getting overwhelmed about finances, about everything. I also just got a new partner whose been supportive but I feel guilty putting him through this experience so early on and it’s making me withdraw from him. I’m trying to focus on starting a travel company etc but i haven’t slept well and have started having panic attacks randomly for the first time in years.

I don't need anyone to relate too, I just want this sadness to disappear.",1
test_pid_1709,"I've ran out of love and fucks to give and honestly that seems to be my destiny : I was such a happy person once even though life was shitty. There was inexplicable hope in me and the will to do good. I've supported so many people through bad times because it made me feel better that at least others could feel better than me. Now I've lost all my hope and can't fight the feeling that the world is a dark and unforgiving place and people will never learn their lesson. There's so much evil out there and I'm so sick of trying to convince others not to be assholes to each other and just sucking up the pain others cause me because I'm understanding like that and know that everyone just tries their very best every day. 
But there is no one for me. I have a family, a partner and a few friends but I don't think they really care. My once best friend who I've supported throughout his depression turned his back on me because of a girl. It honestly hurts so fucking much, he haunts me in my dreams. He's ditched me for the same person in the past and I've managed to accept it and even feel happy for him being in a happy relationship. They broke up a few months later though and he's told me how toxic the relationship has been and how sorry he was for treating me how he did. And now he did it again, consciously, after knowing how much it hurt the first time, without any warning just cut me off. Even worse while I am at the perhaps darkest spot in my life so far. That's what I get for accepting and supporting him unconditionally. It hurts just so fucking much.
My parents can't even stop drinking for once fucking afternoon where I visit them and will insult me etc. They haven't changed one bit since I was a teenager, they are stuck in their toxic patterns and probably will be forever. And I still help them as best as I can with paperwork, cleaning etc. like the fucking doormat I am. You can't choose family, right? Who will I be left with if I stop doing this? Extended family is dead or doesn't speak to me since I was a kid anyway.
I try not to think about my relationship too much because it would make me cry. I've supported him through every hardship he's faced. He tries to do the same but... He can't really understand me, sometimes he doesn't try and gets fed up with me, tells me off or brushes off what I say. I know I've turned into such a negative person that he can't take it anymore. I'm dragging him down like people in my life have dragged me down and left me drowning alone. I'm not sure he loves me anymore, I'm not even sure I love him. He's the last straw. I'm left with nothing if he leaves.
My life is falling apart. I'm supposed to go to therapy soon but I doubt it will help. There seems to be something wrong with me as a person. It's probably my loss to be like that - I'm from a broken poor toxic family, I'm destined to be like that forever. Our world and society isn't for people like me. I'm a born loser.",1
test_pid_1710,"I’m I living my life wrong? : This morning way before people had woken up, it’s Saturday and people tend to sleep more on the weekend. Yeah so I checked Facebook and found myself on classmates pages for 14 years ago. 
Most of them are in relationships, many have hit married and kids, some are not married but gut kids. Don’t don’t have any education, just high school.
And here you got me:
I’ve never been in a relationship, I’ve never be b the type of person being in a relationship just for the sake of being in one. I’m also not the type of person that get in love easy at all. 
I have never had the feeling of “oh I want kids someday, I want to be a mother in the future” No, since my early childhood I have always said “I will never want kids” til this day I don’t want kids. My parents know it and my friends too. I’ve even told my parents I’ll get the surgery to cut my eggs or I’ll hav my future partner do it.
Since my early childhood I’ve been loving school and studying. Guess what? I’m still studying and love it, I’m working too, but I study full time, and I’m all invested in it. 
But while I was at Facebook and til now I’m thinking” Am I doing something horribly wrong, am I living my life wrong, am I wasting my life, should I stop and just find myself a partner to marry and have kids soon?” 
This overwhelmed me and I got so emotional that I cried for myself and got this lump in my stomach. 
I know life isn’t a competition of who get to get things or whatever the fastest. But I just can’t accept this right now, I want to and I believe in it, but I just can’t make myself to accept it right now as my head is full of “Am I ruining my life?” “Have I been wrong all my life til now?”
Even people younger than me have husbands and wife’s and kids.

I’ve considered going to the school counselor, but I’m a bit afraid if I tell them I’m suicidal they might call the cops on me or something and I can’t deal with that. I can’t tell my father, as I know that he will just dismiss me as an attention seeker or something. He’s said before in the past that he thinks that any teenager that says that they’re suicidal are just “punks” and that if I ever told him that, he’d give me the gun to shoot myself with. Pretty sure the last part was a joke, but he was serious about the first bit so I don’t want to tell him. I’ve considered telling my sister since she might understand, but I don’t want to bother her since she’s on a vacation with her boyfriend. This leaves my mother. I’m afraid to tell her, but she’s the best option I think. I’ve tried telling her before, but she didn’t take me seriously. That’s my fault, though, since I couldn’t work up the courage to say it seriously and said it a bit jokingly as a defense mechanism, I guess.

But things are very very bad this last year, I am 100% in a “down period” (just what I always called my severe depressive episodes) and thoUgh I’ve experienced many down periods the extent of this one hasn’t been felt since I was still stuck at home. It’s taking over everything - I can’t eat, I cry just being up , have anxiety attacks when I have to leave my room, etc. Most of all I’m unable to A) make it to class and B) complete any of my course work bc I literally just cannot focus or remember anything. I’m very confident in my intelligence but it’s just back to the same things as high school , my brain feels empty when I try to do anything. 
I think I need to drop out of school so I can focus on therapy and figuring out myself bc I can’t live this way anymore - I’ve been fighting and repressing for so long and I’m just too weakened now. I’m just not sure if it’s the right thing to do. Everyone I know who doesn’t have these issues says I should just keep trying bc I’m so close to graduating (next semester).

So, I keep dreaming since the age of 12 about my childhood house, wich I lived in since I was born, to the age of 11.
At the age of 12-13 I always dreamed about the same scene, were I was alone outside the building were my apartment was, in a park next were was the canal that ran through the neighborhood across the street.
I was just wandering outside admiring my ancient neighborhood, and I always woke up nostalgic and kinda sad. The weather was always nice, everything was green, it felt like the middle of summer during school break. 
Then, dream that stopped these identical dreams was the one where I finally entered my appartement.
Bassicaly the whole building was somehow destroyed (as if there had been a fire). The ceiling gave seen on the sky, since our my apartment was in the last floor. It was terrifying.
After that, the last time I saw my childhood building /house was in a apocalyptic atmosphere where the ruins became some sort of shelter were people I didn't know where hiding.
(Bewteen this dream and the next one related to houses I Iive/lived in, it was basically just nightmares were I hanged myself, fighting violently with my family, and harming myself, over and over again, at a point were I was afraid to go to sleep). 
Then, the dream about my current house. It was last year, and it showed me, in the third person, sleeping in the living room since I couldn't sleep in my own room IRL. There was brambles coming out of my body and strangling to death my family members. 
It was during the period were my mental health was getting really bad. Because of it and my abusive dad, I didn't know what was real or not anymore (memory loss). I feared that everything was my fault and that I was lying on what happened to me. 
1 week ago, I dreamed about moving out with my family in a house. And yesterday I dreamed about moving out (still with my family) to my supportive aunt's old city. I had mixed feelings about it. 
And... That's it. I just wanted to share these dreams. And eventually see if anybody here had a similar experience. 
It made me realize what was heppening to me wasn't normal, and that I was going completely insane. 
I think it's both amazing and horrifying, that these identical dreams kept portraying the state of my mental health trough years, and helped me understand my emotions and my needs. At least that's how I personally see it.
When I was 12-13, it was depression, that I'm still trying to recover from to this day, then it became C-PTSD, a result of my abusive parents and my seizures that kept getting worst since my situation never changed.
I'm also suffering from some sort of amnesia : I forgot most of my childhood. That's why it made me so happy to see my childhood house.
And, the reason I remember some memory and dreams is that I wrote a diary, since I forget everything.",1

For the past 2 days I have been pissed because a friend of mine made a comment to me, it was more like being interrogated more and a ways of my sexual orientation, it's because I don't have a lot of sexual history. I go to bars, parties, and the internet, but I choose not push myself into sex until the right person comes along. I really want to have a good income, and i'm looking for maturity. Anyway back to the topic, I was talking to someone and she suddenly ghosts me, but I haven't talked to him in a while. I had been down due to my job, and I have seen how better off they are. We had talked about that, but we talked about why I distanced myself from them, and every time i'm around them they talk about how many bitches they fuck, and how much money they make and the extravagant lifestyle they have, and why i'm still single, and then I was asked if I was gay and I was pissed and offended by that. That was like a cheap shot, and it's because I never was into sports, and it was my taste in music, movies, television and my choice of being to myself. I have nothing against gays but I never had no luck with females, but I do admit I am a little jealous of their lifestyles and I wish I had some kind of stability in my own life.

It's not working, I still feel the same day after day. Week after week. Nothing's changed. It's always the same result. I just end up talking about something random and wait for the time to pass. Cause it ends up being the same as when I walked in the place. What's the point? Honestly, if it wasn't court sanctioned, I wouldn't even go. It supposed to help. It's supposed to help you overcome the unfortunate depression.  Or at least maybe start to. She said ""It's supposed to make you open up so you can work through the problems and issues.""

I’m currently getting help at school and I’m having therapy. It seems fine on paper but I’ve been thinking a lot about suicide lately. It doesn’t seem to improve. I’m numb all the time and can’t seem to do anything nor talk to anyone. I don’t have any friends and never receive messages. I’ve not gone school for about 60% of the year so far and never felt relief or true hapiness in these past years. As a 16 y/o kid in The Netherlands, you have to attend school. You need to until you’re 18. I feel isolated and lonely. Being my age and having autism makes it hard for me to maintain a strong bond with someone. Most people my age don’t understand feeling depressed. I’ve told almost everyone I talk to on a daily basis about my mental health and why I’m not at school. About 2 of them (which were both girls) seemed to care... for less then a month. Suicide seems like the answer even though I know it’s not. Something inside me wants to make my friends and family be filled with pain. That’s the only way I know they cared about me. I would set an example for them.

I had a review some time ago, was told all was great. I was doing a good job. Recently I was told I am no longer supervisor. They don't believe I'm good enough. I went from being perfect to being crap with absolutely no indication in between things were getting bad.
The manager told me all this face-to-face, and I thought okay. Fair enough. Maybe I do need support. But then she left me a letter, basically telling me that she'll be watching and if I don't improve I'll be fired. This is bullshit, putting it nicely. I was only told I was lacking in the areas needed to be a supervisor, now she's telling me I'm crap at my job in general.
So ... stacking shelves, the simplest job, and I cannot even do that right. I thought I'd hit rock-bottom when she told me I wasn't supervisor any more. But no ... now I know my job is on the line. My flat, my car, everything I own is on the line if I lose this job. And it turns out there is a giant pit below rock-bottom. 
My sister-in-law is due to give birth any day now, but I feel so goddamn numb. I've spent several days over with her and my brother, just in case, just waiting for my little niece to arrive, and all I can think is: ""they have achieved this. My brother is now doing great, she's having a baby. And me? I can't even stack shelves"". My dad is visiting as well, and in the time I've hung out with them I feel like an outsider. He laughs at her jokes, talks to her, plays PS4 with my brother, talks to him ... me? I just sit there feeling isolated. I try. I made a few jokes, only for everyone to ignore me. Someone else makes the same joke a second later and everyone is laughing.
I'm on holiday for a week from work right now, and have had a couple of interviews. One I thought went really well. I didn't get it. Today I had another. I know I didn't get that either. But it doesn't surprise me. When you manage to go below rock-bottom, I guess there's no way out. I belong here. As nothing. As a failure.

test_pid_1740,"I'm losing my mind : Hi there Reddit. I never thought I'd turn to an internet group for help (no offence), but after years and years of trying to get a sense of control in my life, I don't know who I can really turn to anymore. I hope its not an issue, but I'll need to give some backstory, so here goes. 
I've been overweight nearly my entire life. I found it harder and harder to control my eating as I got older (and got my hands on money for fast food), and even as a child I can remember fighting with my parents because they wanted me to eat the child portions at restaurants. Ten years and hundreds of diets down the line, I have completely lost control of my eating to a level that I'm spending hundreds of pounds a month on fast food. Even over the last three days, I've eaten two or three sandwiches at lunch each day, chocolate, crisps etc etc. I've had two massive dominoes, McDonald's and KFC, each time to a point where I'm so full I feel ill and tonight made myself throw up a £45 dominoes order worth of pizzas, chicken and cookies. I've tried what feels like hundreds of times to lose weight, and lost nearly 90 pounds in the summer, was really beginning to feel as though I was doing something meaningful and that I was going to escape the pain of being obese, before a friend (who I will talk about later) cut me off and my eating and exercise just collapsed. This collapse in my healthy mindset caused me to flunk my A-Levels, and lost a place at a top 10 university in the world for History, going from motivated to barely even wanting to go to university. The same goes for my drinking, where I often have been so drunk at parties that I've passed out and broken people's stuff, at one point I think I slapped someones butt and basically shamelessly hit on them in front of people and still feel awful for doing something that I thought I could never bring myself to do, realising in retrospect I drink to change how people perceive me, from an introvert to this outgoing, funny guy who loves to party. I'm not a regular drinker, but when I drink, I drink; to a level that I am throwing up everywhere in my own home as I'm drinking a whole bottle of vodka on my own. 
I've been romantically fucked my whole teenage life. I'm 19, gay and the only action I think I ever had was with a guy who did it to steal weed out of my  back pocket while we were kissing, and have aspects to my sexuality that honestly make me want to kill myself. Due to my sexuality and my weight I learnt to hate myself, and became so depressed that in February of 2018 I tried to hang myself with a belt, but the hanger I was using snapped due to my weight, so ironically i owe my life to my obesity. When I opened up to friends, many of them fell away from me, distancing themselves from the crazy kid. I ended up forming unhealthy relationships with some of the only people that stayed with me through my struggles, which caused them to fall away from me. Most notably, I fell in love with a boy in my year at boarding school extremely heavily due to the fact that I perceived him as my saviour (as on many occasions he wouldn't leave me alone because he knew I was ready to kill myself at the time). Losing that friend was the catalyst to allowing my diet to fall apart, and whilst I wish him the best in life, I can't help but feel that if he'd just held on a few more months, I could be healthy and happy now. Now I'm working a job I hate in a country I desperately want to leave.
I'm anxious, I'm afraid of my own mind and feel like I won't ever be able to lose weight. I just wish I didn't exist anymore to be honest, and the things I felt so passionate about, mainly shooting (I shot for England as a teen), and aviation, have all slid away and I feel alone and lost without anybody to truly talk to. There are so many things I desperately want to tell people but I just can't bring myself to. After losing my friends at school due to my mental health, I've put up walls around myself where I'm naturally suspicious of everybody and so won't tell them how I feel. 
All I have left is my dream just to leave everything behind and move to the country in America, somewhere like Oregon where I could find a friend in nature, at least, and be able to leave my 300lb, romantically desolate and depressed life behind me.",1

I wanted to die and I just felt stuck. Constantly screwing up, not moving forward of getting better at anything. It was a toxic environment that I didn't fit into and I was drowning.
A friend got diagnosed with cancer and I was willing to shave my head in show of support. Our tutor at the hospital, who had tired to help me in the past, called me one night and told me it wasn't a good idea to shave my head. She told me of someone her husband knew who was depressed and that lady shaved her head. But the sudden drastic change made things worse and this woman ended up committing suicide.
This scared me and I left my hair long. But I hated it. I felt like it was choking me but I was too afraid of the effect it would have.

test_pid_1748,"Sometimes I'm so lonely it hurts to breathe : I've been alone the vast majority of my thirty some years on this Earth. If you didn't know me you, you might assume I'm a loner...but I'm not. I've always craved social interaction, but as far back as I can remember I've always been on the outside looking in. I just never really ""fit in"" no matter what I tried. My own cousins would talk shit about me (to me mind you) and leave me out of things they did. I would occasionally make friends, but I distinctly remember my first ""friend"" (that I can remember at least) who was my neighbor, telling me at school that I couldn't talk/hang out with her because her friends thought I was weird (never did specify exactly why, possibly just my age as I was a kindergartner and I think my friend was in second grade) so we could only be friends at home not at school.
Throughout life I had friends that would do that. In fourth grade I even had a bully end up with me in the nurses office (I was sick, she hurt her ankle on the playground) and start being really nice to me, which confused the shit out of me...until she apologized about always being mean to me, but she had to because ""they"" didn't like me, and that she actually thought I was cool. Same thing in 6th grade, I was bullied on the bus but had become close friends with one of the other two kids who were at my stop....the kids on the bus wanted her to push me out of the seat next to her, and afraid they'd fuck with her she made up a lie about her mom knowing mine and getting in trouble if she did it. Neither of us talked to the boy, but on a different day I sat next to him because there were no other spots and he had never said or done anything to me. However the kids on the bus did much the same thing as to my friend only in this case asked him if he was okay with me sitting by him to which he responded with an angry tirade about me and how he wished I would sit somewhere else (but doing that would have meant sitting next to someone who would physically hurt me)
Anyways shit like that happened a lot, I even made really close friends with a few popular people....who's friends would hate me and constantly ask them why they put up with me. Although they'd respond simply with I was fine/cool whatever...the friends who constantly talk shit and they never really got in between, just kept being friends with me.
Moving forward, even my ""best friend"" in highschool was a shady bitch (I knew she could be shady, I didn't realize how bad until later) when I reconnected with one of the two friends I have now who let me know all the shit she used to talk about me which was later confirmed by other people I hadn't really known in highschool but ran into after. One of my bfs in highschool, who was super cocky but not even that special was embarrassed about being with me, despite constantly tonguing his ex everywhere they went...so sufficed to say I have social anxiety, and self esteem that's in the negatives. 
I ignored the bullying (as far as telling any adults) and internalized everything by spending pretty much every waking minute I wasn't at school sleeping, and when I was at school, reading to escape and try to ignore the shit talking. 
I never really figured out what it is about me that's wrong, besides being shy and quiet. I try to be nice, try to ask people questions about themselves, talk about things I know their interested in but even as an adult I just have some acquaintances, and literally two people I can call friends.
Recently I finally found the courage to admit how bad I am to my doctor and she stated me on an antidepressant/anti anxiety meds. I've been on it for about a month, and it's been helping a lot. I've been able to start getting things done, and I've found it a bit easier to talk at work without over thinking everything so much that by the time I figure out what to say the conversations moved too far past that point. One of the biggest stresses/struggles in my life is a lack of friends. I'm constantly stuck home alone with no one to talk to, or go out and do things with. I actually thought I hit the jackpot recently...I came across a post on the marketplace from someone who moved to the area and was looking to make friends with people who had mutual interests, all of which were things I love to do. So I sent a simple message saying I saw her post and thought I'd reach out. I saw that she saw the message but she didn't respond. I decided to just give up, but one of the only two friends I have said maybe she just didn't know how to respond so send her another message actually mentioning options for things we could do, so I did. I mentioned an event coming up in a couple weeks that fit what she in theory would like. I was excited when she responded that she had been interested but couldn't find my message and was glad I reached out, so I went ahead and friended her since she had issue friending me, and told her what I I had done. However it seems as soon as she accepted the friend request she blocked me. Which is whatever, she for whatever reason was obviously just not interested in trying to form a friendship with me, and I'd rather find out now rather then keep hoping it could lead to a friendship that just wasn't going to happen....but it just feels bad. Someone who was looking actively for friends, rejected me so hard she felt the need to block me. I even said if she wasn't interested that was fine I just wanted to offer. 
I feel absolutely pathetic that I only have two friends, who I rarely ever see, and barely even talk to. I used to feel like I was second best, I was always second to someone else even in relationships. Second best to my sibling, but lately I feel like I've moved back to 5th place. No matter what method I try, I just can't seem to make a friend. About a year ago I realized the only time people spoke to me is when I reached out to them first. My two friends are the only ones who reached out again on their own. I've tried contacting and getting together with people I would have considered my friends to hang out at some point, but after constantly getting told no for whatever reason, or getting bailed on at the last minute and never hearing from them again....I stopped trying. 
I just wish I knew what was fucking so terrible about me that no one wants to ever be friends with me. Even with my family I don't hear from them unless I'm reaching out. I know they love me, they just don't like me.
I can't help feeling like a huge pathetic loser. I'm sitting here bawling my eyes out, sick to my stomach, because damn I'm just a useless, worthless pile of shit that no one can stand to be around. I even went so far as never talking about my issues/depression and always put on a happy face. I was told by someone who had started talking to me less and less that I was just ""too depressing"" and it seemed to help some, I was able to make acquaintances. It was still only ever that, simple his and small talk...never anything of substance. I just wish I knew what was wrong with me, so I could stop being alone.
Having a mild panic attack, because I'm a loser who can't make friends. Even people who are looking for friends don't want to talk to me 🤷🏼‍♀️",1

test_pid_1755,"It sucks to be a teen with depression/anxiety because everyone assumes you're just attention-seeking and don't know what true mental disorders are like. : When you're ages 14-17 and the topic of mental health comes up in conversation, if you say you have depression they immediately assume you don't know what the hell you're talking about. 
If you reveal anything to adults, their immediate train of thought is: ""You're a kid, you don't even have to work yet.  What is there to worry about in school? Gee, I wish I was your age again because everything was so simple back then. Kids these days complain about the smallest things..."" and etc. 
This attitude is exacerbated by the teens who jump on the ""mental health is now trendy"" bandwagon. They self-diagnose as depressed because every so often they get a bit sad or lazy. The kids who self-harm not as a coping mechanism but as a means of getting attention piss me off the most. Feel free to downvote, I know self-harm is a serious issue and I used to do it too, but I'm talking about the ones who do it purposely in visible places and aren't actually suffering from mental illness. 
I'm never the first one to talk about my experiences with mental health, but if it comes up in conversation, I sometimes feel the need to clarify that I was diagnosed by a professional because SO MANY teens are self-diagnosing using those BS mental health tests online, then using those scores to show off.

What I mean is though, is that often it feels like, with the way they react, it's not so much that they think it's bad that I'm unhappy, but that they think I'm bad for being unhappy. As if I'm the problem, the only problem here. I don't have a problem that needs to be addressed, I AM the problem that needs to be addressed.

test_pid_1760,"Just another note on depression : I don't even know why I am writing here, but it felt like the only place I could put things out at the moment. It is a note I wrote today during fighting some inner demons. This may not be depression, it may be a mild life fog, but I am no doctor to say. Constructive feedback and not are welcome. Thanks for passing by.
I think I am going through some depression. I will clarify. I am healthy, in my 30s, within the norm, I have a well paid job, a mostly healthy family, good childhood, some friends here and there. I am not busy, or burned out, I do what I need to do and I end up with free time in my hands too. Why do you even complain? Would say the practical brain. There is no complaint in stating the state of your mind. It is a fact, it may change depending on daytime or weather, but it is still the current reality. The point of me diagnosing myself with depression is to face the problem.
I wake up, bit in a rush, head to work, and start my day looking at the faces of other people, in a struggle, hopefully questioning themselves why are they in that metro at that time, going to a place they don't necessarily like. I project these thoughts from my head to theirs. We are a silent and separated unity. I end up looking like them, I feel part of them, but I have no way to get in touch with them and empathize. No way to share the communal pain.
I spend the rest of the day in an office, doing what I need, even having just a bit of fun sometimes, solving problems, fixing things. No stress. Also, no real connection with people, everyone is there because they have to, not by real choice. Discussions are superficial and filtered, it is still work, we need to keep a good image and a good face. People are not struggling together, they are struggling individually.
The work day finished, and I am head quickly out, maybe I manage to see a nice sky, that improves morale, but soon it is metro time. Same faces, same questions.
Back home I cook something simple, say hi to my really nice flatmate, we both are quiet people. It is dark outside, and I should make a decision: social or home. The social decision is hard, meaning going out again, facing another trip or two, having to drink something, having to find an interesting conversation or activity. Better not, I will stay home. Questions that I left early in the morning, re-emerge quickly. Some music and videos will keep them silent. Till it's bedtime.
It is dark and quiet, I may have done some sport during the day, I may be tired physically, my brain is awake. It is just a matter of getting lost in my internal discussion, hoping that the mammal physiological behavior will make these thoughts into a dream soon. It will be easier to digest. Maybe it will take some time.
It's Friday. I am done with work, I will have many hours free before any real duty will come up to me. Social actions are again needed. I am not feeling ready, I don't feel the drive, the reasons, the pleasure to meet. I feel I try to force myself into it. I should go out. I should meet some people. Maybe some new inputs, some new character will enter my life, things may change without me realizing it.
Saturday evening, I am still in bed from the day before, I did not move much, I cleaned a bit. I cooked for myself, simpler, faster. I got some invitations to pubs, music, houses. I kindly refuse. I am not ready, I don't find the drive, the motivation. My stream of thoughts is still there, perpetual. It is almost like a song, words repeat, first verse, second verse, chorus. I know them well, I can sing along.
All this would be solved. If only. I could be in a better state. I could feel part of a group. I could have one or two close friends, physically and mentally, to whom to speak. I would feel they understand me. I would help them too, I would feel part of a collective of minds. I could have a partner. I could have a partner next to me. With similar questions, to go through together. Embracing the problems, being open, no filters needed. But this did not happen in the past and is not happening still. Where are you? Where is the part of me outside of me that still I did not meet. Is there any?
Years are passing by. I may be on the late train, closing time. I may have missed it already, I may be missing it in 5-10 years or so. The state of mind certainly reduces the possibilities of catching the ride. We are social animals, we search for a clan, a family circle. If we find it and accept it, we are well off. If we don’t, are there still going to be people around us like us? We may be all too far from each other to see each other In the real world. Near physically.
I think I am depressed. Something is unresolved in my psychology. I can and did turn it off in the past, and still do. It always re-emerge. I left partners because they were not what I was looking for. Because I was focusing on my issues, my battles, they were not part of it. I left places, lost connections with nice people. I went on, as I am meant to. Now I am still here. I think I am depressed. I think many people are around me. But we are all into this individually, somehow collectively alone.",1

test_pid_1764,"Need advice in life [Reposted] : Dear Reddit,
I am a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering at a Top 5 UK university. I am writing this to ask for some advices related to my life in University. To be honest, I did not enjoy university at all besides the freshers week on my first year. After first year, the engineering curriculum started to get really tough especially subjects like thermodynamics in Chemeng. Because of this, I was spending 9-5 everyday in uni studying by myself. Which leads to the second issue.
I am a loner in class. I believe it stems from my introverted lifestyle in which i like to play games and sleep all day during the weekend. I am unable to make deep connections with my classmates although I talk to them a lot. I have no problems socialising but I just seem to not find anyone interesting/compatible to be friends with in school.
Third point, I am suffering with MAD depression rn. My grandpa has gotten cancer, hes really old and is very far away from me atm (16 hours flight one way). I really miss him so much but because of the really hard engineering classes, I cant really go back until at least June. This has made me feel really sad and I cant concentrate on my classes anymore. I have 2 courseworks to be submitted by this week which counts for the grade and I just feel like bombing it tbh.
Please reddit, I would appreciate if you guys could give me a good advice that I can follow so that I can finish this damn degree and rest in peace :)",1

I cried so hard for that dog, well it was the only time i cried emotionally since i was a kid, and I'll get back to why i started off with my dog dying. When I was like grade 5 I realized my family was going to shit. Grade 5 when everything started to go down hill. Before it, it was mostly blocking off people that i thought wast just toxic people but ill never know because i went silent.
""friends"" isn't that a word a lot of people cherish? not me my first emotional sadness and realization is that a person can  easily be replaced through social status, i had trust issues because of my mom. at some point i just wanted to be better for people probably grade 8 i just wanted to listen to people and fix their problems instead of fixing mine. to distant myself from what i really feel, its hard for me to look for actual friend buts its easy for others to get attached to me since I've adjusted myself for other people more to the point that I'm just frustrated since i cant seem to find ""the real me"" anymore at home when my family sees me my ""normal"" smile and nod, my siblings the silent one, my friends the funny-loud-outgoing-nerd-smart-tough-brave I've been called many things just to fit in with the people I'm surrounded with.
People would think my mom was the best caring mom, well I thought that to but when there's money involved she's the most ignorant (this is the part where my mom gave me trust issues that everyone has another side ""money the root of all evil""). The constant pressure from her that i should be better than everyone made me selfish and i hated it. The times she ruined my passion for something because of the pressure she was putting on me, she made everything not fun of me. I still love her but damn i just wish she could see what i see.
My father is the coolest, he's the smartest person i know in the flesh, but he doesn't know how his words affects me or my siblings, and hes the most unlucky one. His first wife he had to divorce because he caught her with someone else now he got stuck raising 4 kids (all boys) then she found my mom which then made another batch of four kids (2 boys 2 girls me being the youngest) him being 66yo he has a lot of knowledge in that head but sometimes forget words hurt, he to pressured to do things i didn't want to do because i was to silent I couldn't say no because he just gets disappointed and it just drags me down to that dark hole more when i feel that disappointment so i just try but it just drains me. Then recently 2019 without consideration of me being in the other room he was telling his sister about life and eventually came to the part where i was never planned. 
My siblings well i don't know why but they never had a god damn care for me well you could say tough love i don't know but shit i just wanted to talk someone so i go to their room and they immediately ask ""why are you here"" with the most irritating tone so i just respond with whatever like ""sorry I'm looking for the scissors."" then i just realized it was just me and my imagination. grade 5 after that i just went deeper and deeper in to that pit  when i finally got to that part of wanting to end it all with the attempt i couldn't i just thought it wasn't the right time, coming back to the dog, that dog was the only living soul i could put out who i was and what i felt, eventually i felt dumb cause i dint get an answer. I regretted so much after the dog died because i didn't love him enough i was a bad owner.
with all this emotions and no one to talk to i just thought i could share some of my bullshit life here in the internet. well yeah i share my shit to some select few but my problem with them is all of them dont know how to comfort well im fine with it its just their comforting me the wrong way like saying ""don't worry you can always buy a new dog"" or ""yeah dont be to down i feel what you feel"" yeah i just cant stand it i'd rather be left alone than hearing those things

test_pid_1767,"I am really sad and lost. : I always seem to be the one to approach other people; I am the one going out and talking to the introverts and trying to be friends, but it never feels like anyone cares for me.

What is the right way to feel about things? What shouldn't be subjective? Why can't I ever seem to feel the lord? Haven't I opened up my heart to him? Am I socializing among others, or with others?

Why is it that I feel like I'm such a small part of everything, even when I try not to be? Maybe I expect things too quickly. Maybe I get too attached. Maybe I have a dependency on others for comfort. I think my extroversion is an insecurity, but I've had it my whole life.

I've been 1-foot off the stool, been immensely happy, been immensely sad. For the most part I have a good grip on my emotions though I've become insensitive to others going through the same thing. Maybe as a way to block out that reality.
I've rejoined society, got an okay job, good relationship with family and the people I work with, but I've never felt wanted, and I'm terrified this is who I'll be till the day I die, like everyone else grew up but I just got older.

It's pretty much routine at this point, that I am forced to hold the tears back. I opened up to my mom, told her everything, and she broke down in front of me, now I am regretting telling her everything, she non stops worries about me, that's not what I wanted.

I just wanna be okay. I wanna be normal. I wanna be included. I know that’s selfish. I know that you’ll probably think that I should try harder. But I just don’t have the will to try anymore. I really don’t. If no one can notice or care about me enough to include me and make me feel like I matter then why should I even try?
I feel lost. Lost in the where I belong in life. If I belong in life. Idk. Idek if this makes sense either. I’m just spewing what’s in my head into text. Just trying to make sense of everything I feel. Because I feel sad, angry, lost all wrapped into one rn. I wanna just curl in a ball and cry but I also wanna scream. Idk I’m just a mess, lost in the world. Looking for something to go my way for once. I always seem to be fighting the uphill battle and I’m getting tired. Idk if I can make it to the top of that hill anymore. 
Thanks for reading whatever the fuck this is if you did. You took more time to care then anyone.",1
test_pid_1773,"Iv got a question. : Could anyone out there be up for talking privately about going through a divorce? I’m currently going through with my wife of three years and yes before you say anything. I know three years not that long, but guys we was in love. First girl I did anything with. Slept together. Showered together. Smoked. Watched movies. Built legos. Play video games together. Loved together. Swam together. If there was something we could do together. We did it. She was my best friend. She was. She was my best friend before we got married. And now she is gone. 
And I’m trying to live with the fact she is gone. It’s like something is messing from me. Like someone died and I didn’t even know who they were. Both of us are extremely torn by this. And no. I don’t really want to go into detail. Somethings can be spoken of. But I just want to talk about going through this alone?....this is extremely lonely. 
I try talking to people and I just feel like I don’t belong. Or I’m just a bother now. I feel like no one really wants to hang out. Or do much. I did everything with her for so long the little things remind me of what we had. See this on YouTube oh she would love this. Funny Facebook video I should send this to her. Like. It’s so dumb. I’m over it. But for some reason it would go away. 
I feel like I’m going crazy you guys. I know I’m not. But something is telling me I am. So if there is anyone out will you put up with me. Please. Send me a message. I’d love the company. 
Thank you.",1
test_pid_1774,"Feeling nothing is worse than feeling sad : Recently I finished my 2nd run of school (after working for 10 years) to get a better job.
As a straight A student I somehow had hope that life get better.
I pulled through so much that I had hope again.
Now I can't find a job because I don't have experience in my new field, and while this is frustrating, I feel nothing. I quit my job that made me depressed so I could get better and now I'm just drowning deeper.
I feel no excitement for great things, for example, seeing my best friend after half a year.
I feel no hunger and I only ate because he invited me to dinner, no enjoyment, our hugs feel empty and everything feels pointless. I truly love this person from the bottom of my heart but the feeling of, he's better off without me, becomes unbearable.
It feels like it's just a matter of time that I will feel the same about my relationship, the feeling of, this world is a better place without me..., and while I know that's not true now, I am afraid my mind will trick me into thinking otherwise in the future.

I can’t support myself with my part time job so I still live at home. I hate it cause I’m constantly getting asked when I’m going to get a full time job or why don’t I go out more. Full time jobs in my area that are related to my college degree don’t exist. And going to do retail just gets me shit talked by my dad. (I did retail for months before my current job and it was months of him shit talking me about getting a real job.) Going out to hang with friends isn’t much of an option either. I only have 1 friend that stayed around (by which I mean stayed in town) after college and she’s busy with her own life. I don’t want to be that friend that clings to someone. 
I feel like 90% of my friends have moved on with their lives. Full time jobs, buying houses, getting engaged. Being happy. When some of them came back during the holidays I met with a group and it was nice, but I still felt so depressed. They all sound so happy with themselves. And I’m just not. Ever since meeting with them they are trying to invite me to their gatherings/travel plans and I just can’t afford it. And it just makes me feel small every time I have to turn them down. 
I’ve always dealt with depression since back in middle school. My anxiety came in college, but now I feel so exhausted. I feel like I’m not going anywhere. I graduated with a degree I wanted to change my junior year because I knew there would be no career path for me. My parents said just finish it and we’ll think about what to do after you graduate. 2 years later and my self hatred has grown. I feel no one arounds me understands my stress and low opinion I have of myself. I’ve tried talking about it with my parents and it’s just ‘you shouldn’t feel like that’ or ‘it sounds like you’re saying I’m a bad parent.’ The conversation always turns and suddenly I’m trying to console their parenting.  
I don’t talk with my friends about these feelings. Idk why I’m writing this. Maybe it’s suppose to be therapeutic? Idk. It’s just I want to put this out there. Cause today I had a scary thought. I’m not happy. I don’t remember the last time I was and if this keeps going the way it is I don’t think I’ll ever turn 30.",1

If I try to go too far into the cold, I instantly run back to the warm blanket.

I struggle with basic self care and I don’t eat well. I’ve always been told I’m attractive so I feel like I base my self worth on that. I find it difficult to leave my house without makeup. If I feel like I look bad in public I feel really uncomfortable. I always compare myself to other girls. Instagram also seriously affects my mental health. I judge myself based on how many likes or comments I get and worry sooo much about whether people think I’m pretty. I’m always on my phone to try and distract myself from anxious and sad thoughts. Do you think I may be depressed?,1
test_pid_1781,"You think you know pain? Life story incoming... : This post will probably get flagged. Either way, let's do this.
I'm just a dude. 25 years on this earth, born into poverty, but hey I'm white so who gives a hoot? I've almost died a mere three times in early childhood. Father left when I was six. Textbook drunk deadbeat. Got my second chance at age 12 when mother, brother and myself moved to the UK to live with mother's partner (let's call her Stepmother).
Due to the newfound support of middle class finances, my grades in school improved dramatically. Unfortunately at the same time, I was both bullied and sexually harassed (Apparently being a weak scrawny German nerd isn't the best thing to be).
6th form was better, arguably the best time of my life. Problems were simple: what clothes to wear, what video games to play, and although I had no idea how girls operated, I still enjoyed spending time with the handful of girlfriends I managed to keep interested for more than 2 weeks. (Teenage years are very fickle let's be honest 😂).
Throughout these times I kept busy. Hobbies were taken seriously and maintained with fervor and what little money I earned from my weekly paper round. I played Basketball too so I wasn't a complete slacker.
I had a couple of seizures as well, which were soon brought under control with anticonvulsants. Some of you may be familiar with the mind-calming effects of Sodium Valproate! Coming now to an epileptic or bi-polar person near you! All seemed right.
Then University hit. I chose Psychology with Counseling, as I wanted to provide to people the service that I now realized, I much needed. I didn't have the grades needed for the Uni in our town, so I chose a lesser option to one that was about a 30 min drive away. 
I pulled through first year, but fell out the second. Stress began to pile up and I was barely able to look after myself. Personal standards began to slip with regards to food and hygiene. Although I had money, friends and a roof over my head, there was no motivation to speak of. The anxiety of lonesome living ground this to dust. I was clearly not prepared for this next step in life I thought, so back home I went.
I spent the next six months unemployed as a freeloader at my parents house. This was the first time I ever felt suicidal. Between the anger and frustration at my own failure and the pressure placed on me by anything and everything I could name, was a sense of shame so deep it warped my self-confidence and my identity. I started keeping a diary, and with each entry I could see the emotions burning over and the motivation burning out.
It got to the point where I felt no longer human, that I was but a tool to be used and discarded - a tool that soon realized that it had no use. A tool with no use is a pointless concept, and so I started depriving myself of basic human needs, in a feebleminded attempt to atone for my meaningless existence. No food. No water. No friends. Nothing except grief and anger.
Yes that's right, anger. A burning fury toward the world so hot it probably burned through most of my synapses. I started blaming everything I could to alleviate the pain I felt. Injustice in the world. Society. Everything.
I eventually landed a job at a call center. Processing payments and chasing account details over the phone for a big Telecomms company. ""Finally, my luck turns!"" I thought. It was a dead end job with minimum wage, but it was a start. And I started to hope once again. Maybe, if I tried hard enough, I could prove I wasn't useless. Maybe then I could get somewhere.
And for the next two years I worked my butt off. I excelled at my role, did overtime when asked and volunteered when not. I made friends with everyone, and everything seemed right as rain. And then it happened - my first panic attack at the age of 22, around the same time a good friend of mine died very suddenly from Sudden Adult Death Syndrome at the age of 19. One day he was there, the next day he was dead. 
The palpitations during the panic attack were new and - understandably - unbearable. I thought I was having a heart attack and that I was going to die. An ambulance was called. I calmed down after about 2 hours. Everything went back to normal. Or so I thought.
The attacks became regular, and eventually got bad enough for me to take two weeks off for stress - something never done before. During this time, all the colleagues I made friends with were starting to leave one by one, for various reasons. Maybe it was my time too? And so I left the company in search for greener pastures.
I picked up another call center gig, this time with an existing friend. Again it was outbound calls, so I was sort of cold calling just like before. The same procedure followed, I made friends and gave it 100% effort. I eventually got promoted once to an advisory role and once again to an IT position due to some skills I picked up while I was unemployed (free online courses and stuff). Once again I thought ""what a lucky break!"" I was earning a comfortable living, and was able to support my family through some tough times.
Alas, all good things must end. And so, just like before, the friends I had made at the company started leaving one by one. But I stuck with where I was, as I could see a future in my current position. The anxiety and depression were still at large yes, but manageable with only the occasional sick day or early finish.
Fast forward to around May/June last year. Boom. Stepmother diagnosed with Motor Neurons Disease (think Stephen Hawking). Only this type was a lot more aggressive. What started as slurred words soon deteriorated into much more. As my stepmother slowly lost control of her faculties, my family and I had to care for her around the clock. Eating, going to the bathroom, hygiene. Everything. If I had to describe it, it was as if caring for an infant, only instead of watching the beautiful potential of life as it develops, you get to watch a loved one die more and more each day, and they don't even have the blessing to be unconscious for half of it.
During this time, my work performance tanked hard. Understandably so. I explained my situation to my employer, and it was decided to place me on part time work. But my mental state simply continued to deteriorate. What used to be weekly panic attacks turned to daily anxiety, and every shift at work was torture. I couldn't uphold my end of the contract I signed, so, after a long and unsuccessful ""return to work"" program, I was demoted in December. The idea was less stress, but work is always stressful for me. I either take it seriously, or not at all - there's no middle ground for me. I'm either useful, or useless.
Shortly after, my bed bound stepmother developed a clot in her lungs, and two weeks later she died. It was the first time I ever saw a dead body, let alone that of a loved family member. I cried no tears in front of the family, instead retreating to my bedroom to cry and howl in private.
It's now been a month since her death, and my family is shattered. All are numb to my attempts at communicating, and it seems everyone has moved on except me. I feel...alone and cold. Not a day goes by where I don't feel a vile concoction of shame, regret, bitterness and sorrow. Even my friends are unable to talk to me about the afflictions that plague my mind.
My work is hanging by a thread, and every oath I try to make on my path to recovery, only seems to poison the future I'm so desperately trying to save. I'm not a religious man, and I'm a half-baked atheist at best. The only truth I believe in, is that obliteration of consciousness leads to eternal nothingness. There are no consequences of life in a personal sense. Life has no meaning, so why bother? I've tried flipping the perspective and thinking ""Well why *not* bother?"" but that's just rhetoric for passivity and stagnation. I've also tried to imagine the future as an eternal beacon of unpredictable hope, but I don't have the patience for such drivel. Why place trust in something that cannot be predicted? I'd sooner bank on the cosmic chances of the universe exploding, creating itself again, and all the particles of space dust to slowly align over millions of years in a similar enough way to allow my consciousness to exist once more, if at all.
I've tried everything. Lifestyle changes. Therapy. Seeking a partner. Heck, I've been on antidepressants for 2 whole years. Nothing is getting better, only worse. I fantasize about death every day. How I would die. Where and when. If I got the chance to say goodbye to the people I love. All I have left is fear and death. But here's the kicker: fear is both making me feel suicidal, and preventing me from doing so at the same time. After all, who can think about suicide, when they're having a panic attack?
And so I'm trapped. Trapped in an existence in a world I hate with a passion. Stuck, because the fear the drives me insane is also the very fear that's keeping me alive: just being another statistic.
Tl;Dr I wanna die fam but my body won't let me.

test_pid_1789,"Recently came out of a 72 hour psych hold : Long story short, I got drunk a few weeks back, said I wanted to harm myself on Facebook after an angry rant where I misinterpreted being blamed for my cousin's suicide a few years ago by his family. His family really didn't like him and think he was a great father and I got a little defensive about those remarks.(I know, complicated family pain mixed with alcohol = nothing good) 
The truth was that I wasn't actually going to harm myself and because I was drunk, I actually managed to forget I posted a reply about self-harm until my dad showed up and asked me if I was okay. Then I thought to myself, ""shit, did I say I was going to harm myself? damn... damn... damn"" I told him that I felt like I was being attacked by family on Facebook and trying to defend myself. He told me that a family member had contacted him and asked him to check up on me. As I sat there crying about my cousin's suicide(that was what I was really getting riled up about)
Then I hear a long banging on the door, ""police..."" I thought to myself, ""well I really done it now, I'm in trouble with the police... damn."" 
My dad lets them in and they ask me a few questions, I don't remember exactly what they asked me because I was still drunk and pretty embarrassed that officers were at my place asking me if I was okay over stuff I wrote on Facebook. They did told me to walk outside with them and sit on the steps, my hands were cuffed together with some plastic ties and they told me I wasn't under arrest but that I was going to be put on a 72 hour psych hold. I told them that I knew what that was since I had a psych degree and complied with the order, knowing I was too drunk and upset to make a go at trying to contest it. 
I eventually end up getting a bed in the psych ward later on that day(I got taken in at like 8AM and it took several hours to get a bed) A psychiatrist stops by for 5 minutes to make a quick evaluation on me. This is the first time I'm seeing a psychiatrist so I'm actually excited to talk to them and explain to them what's going on and if I can get a diagnosis for possible depression and anxiety. She looks at me and starts behaving like a salesperson selling snake oil to me: ""There's such an easy road you can go on and you'll feel so much better, you wouldn't believe it! And that's taking anti-depressants!"" 
I told her that I didn't mean any offense to her but I've done extensive research on SSRI's and I wanted to know if I could get a diagnosis by the doctor but pursue CBT, one-on-one therapy, group therapy, meditation/mindfulness(which I had done during graduate school), dietary changes, 30 minute daily exercises, and just small things like that to help with my depression and anxiety. 
She looked at me, and said something really awkward to me.... ""You sound like a smart girl. But why do all of that stuff, when all you need to do is take a pill? I can put you on a trial...... it's your decision on whether you want to take the easy road or the harder bumpier road...""
That was when I really didn't want to continue our conversation further, I realized that the only way she was going to help me is if I agreed to her anti-depressant route instead of exploring other options.  I told her very politely, ""I am sorry to waste your time doctor, but I have to decline on the medication route..."" 
She then just stared at me for a good 3 seconds(it felt like one of those stares that seemed like 5 minutes) and she said with a very neutral expression ""Okay then, you'll be released after 72 hours..."" Just like that, she left, and I never saw her again. 
I was released after 72 hours, I met a bunch of very kind and gentle souls in that psych ward that had very different stories to tell and different degrees of mental illness. 
I was given very little information about followups after my release and on my release record, it stated that I refused treatment and refused to listen to the doctor. It made it seem like I didn't want to get help or get a diagnosis, so the statement on the document made me frustrated. I signed it anyways, because I couldn't stand being caged and locked up for another second and I didn't want to risk getting an extended time due to frustrating the doctor. 
It's been a few weeks since I've been out of there. I'm still actually recovering from the experience since I still feel like a ""bad person"" and my dad now calls me everyday and asks me if I'm doing okay(code word for, you're not going to harm yourself honey right?) and it makes me feel like crap knowing he thinks I'm mentally fragile or on edge. 
I do not use alcohol anymore and I plan on finding out a way to get one-on-one therapy or find a support group for depression and anxiety locally in my county. 
Anyway, my question is simply this, is it possible to find a psychiatrist to talk to without them giving a sales pitch on the latest successful SSRI medication that they think will work wonders for me, or are they going to behave like that doctor at the psych ward did and not want to diagnosis or anything to do with me if I say no to the medications? Am I better off just not getting a diagnosis and working with psychologists and therapists that don't really bother me with those things?",1

test_pid_1795,"I don't think my depression is severe enough to be diagnosable : Since middle school I have felt ""depressed"" not until freshman year when I was caught self harming I had to start going to therapy. I've seen this therapist for roughly three years at this point, and she's wanted to try and move forward with the possibility to starting to process of diagnosis three times. Most recently last week she gave me the ultimatum since my depression is at its worst. I've lost 24 pounds (115 to 91) in the span four months. For a long time I was naïve thinking that I already hit rock bottom. But I was very wrong. Throughout sophomore year I smoked pot excessively, and I couldn't keep up with family or friends let alone basic necessities such as properly care for myself or my room. Doing anything, even as simple as brushing my teeth or organising shoes was too much for me to handle. Now as a junior though I've stopped smoking, im once again unable to do anything. I can't do anything I enjoy, let alone tasks that I feel are taxing. I haven't felt more suicidal in a long time, every morning I hate being alive, I'm angry I'm alive. I hate the fact that I have to live. It doesn't feel like I'm living. My head is detached, it always has been but now that feeling of disconnection is even more. Most days I don't feel like I'm even alive, I'm just here. I can respond to people around me but I hate it. I hate talking to people in my life cause they try to force me to be happy when all I want is to be alone. I can never find peace. Nothing about life is enjoyable, everything is dull.

From going into treatment and the several weeks prior to that I've been feeling emotionally numb.
During treatment I really started to notice it and began thinking of stuff to make myself cry, weird right?
I've normally been quite a sensitive gal. Since hitting my twenties and maybe a lil before that.. (21 in July) I've really became numb.

I quit my old job when my contract expired just before tet (Chinese New Year), counting on jumping into public schools which is extremely easy. Do that for some cash while looking for another real language center job.
I am on stalled job offer #3 at one center. That's right. Offered two jobs already that disappeared due to school closings. This is after being strung along for months by an international school.

Depression is none of those. Depression is that feeling, among many others being carried with you every moment of every day. My depression is even accompanied by horrible anxiety and ADHD, making things even worse for me to handle. And furthermore, if I DID tell somebody how I truly felt, I'm worried I would ruin their day with my sad emotions, or that they would just get sick of listening and zone out.

test_pid_1813,"Final draft : Hi everyone 
To be honest with you I don’t know where to start or even where to end. I’ve always wanted to write down my thoughts at night since I first was going through what I am going through now, but never got around to it. Decided reddit would be the best place for my voice to be heard without my voice being heard.
I just want to start off with saying that I have spent the past year trying to make things better but the old me is never coming back. I lost interest in everything and it doesn’t seem like my life is going anywhere. I wish I could find something I’m good at or a path for me to embark on, but I don’t want to live like this anymore. I understand my parents are trying to help me, but it seems like things aren’t getting better.
Ever since I was little I’ve always been the “quiet” one. So quiet, as a matter of fact, that people think I’m “weird”. I get shy easily in public and can’t hold a normal conversation outside of my family members. The friends I once had all moved on with their lives and I’m stuck in the past. Talking to them feels just as awkward now as it feels for me to talk to a stranger.
I wish I could do well in school again. My whole life, all I had going for me was my academic ability. Some would say it was a gift I was born with, others could say it was my hard work that deserved it. I always performed at the highest levels in school. I have none of that now, as I struggle to attend classes and turn in assignments. I once had perfect attendance and that has turned into the near opposite. I just don’t have any drive or motivation anymore. Nothing to look forward to.
I decided that tomorrow will be my last day. Maybe some will say “don’t worry things will get better”. But I don’t care. You can call me selfish, it doesn’t matter. At the end of the day, I realized that life isn’t for me. Will I have regrets? Yes. I never attended prom, never talked to any girls, never traveled to my parents home country, never got my first job, never drove a car, never got a chance to buy a house or apartment, never got a chance to buy my dream car. It doesn’t matter though. All of my dreams will stay that way: dreams. 
Yes I’ll feel bad for those I leave behind. But at the same time, perhaps leaving them behind is the only way they’ll notice me. I’ll never be the president, I’ll never be in movies, never catch a pass from Tom Brady. But the one thing I will always be is myself. Maybe I’m not perfect, but I am me. I will live as me and I will die as me.
So I decided tomorrow is it. At first I wanted to stay up late and not go to sleep to enjoy my last moments. But now I realized that what I would enjoy most right now is a quiet night of sleep. I don’t want to cry to bed anymore. I don’t want to think those thoughts anymore.
I’m sorry if I ruined anyone’s mood or time wasted reading this. Maybe one day we will meet again. Before I go, I just want to say the thing that would really help right now is if I could just give my mom and dad one last hug.",1

test_pid_1822,"I just want to be happy. : My depression has been so much worse since the death of my best friend. He was taken from me last Sunday, and every night I find myself crying in bed over what has happened. Before this I was finally starting to learn how to be happy again. I was slowly coming to terms with the violent death of my mother, becoming more open with my friends, and learning to not hate myself as much. Now though I just feel like a lot of my progress has been ripped from me, and I guess people can argue that I let my progress be stunted but I can’t help how I feel about this entire mess. Not only have I started having suicidal thoughts again, but I’ve found myself just really down, having zero energy, constantly crying, and just not wanting to be around people. I feel really closed off, and I don’t know what to do because the coping mechanisms that were working aren’t working as much. Mostly because I can’t comprehend why the world has to shoot me when I finally heal from the last bullet it shot into me. I don’t understand why I can’t just be happy for once, and why something terrible has to happen after only a few months of happiness.
I know people argue that happiness will never be permanent, and I am fully aware of that. If you don’t feel sadness then are you even truly living your life? But all my life I’ve been so depressed, angry with myself, and have hated myself. I finally start to not feel these things as much, and then something like this happens. I never expected not to feel sadness, but I guess I didn’t expect something I care about and love with all my heart dying so soon after my mom did. The world could have done anything to make me feel bad. Not give me the internship I was gunning for, cause a rift between me and a friend, car accident... truly anything, and I would have been able to cope my way out of it, but another death? It’s so hard to cope with that because death is something that makes something permanently gone. You can never get that thing back. You can never have memories with them again. Death is so very permanent. A fight with a friend can be resolved, or you can move on knowing you’re both making the best of life and that you have spoken your peace. A new internship can come along, one that might be even better then the one you were gunning for. You can heal from a car accident, and even if you don’t fully heal you can at least learn to live a semi-happy life with the damage. Death though? There is no options there. You can never bring that thing back. You can never resolve that issue. You can never fully move on from it. It’s always there in the back of your mind, watching you, reminding you that it can take something from you at any point and that everything you care about will one day be owned about it.
You see, I’ve lost pets to death and coped okay for the most part, mostly because almost all my pets have died from old age. They lived a full, happy life. I never really comprehended death until I lost someone who was a major part of my life, and now I suppose you can argue I’m over sensitive to it now. I’m worried for death taking every person at some point. I imagine how I would feel if certain people die, and I make myself depressed imagining how lonely life would be without them. Most of the people in my life are going as well with plenty of life to live, but that matters little because now I understand that there is a chance for anyone dying at any point. Every time someone drives a car, every time some walks across the street, every time someone gets sick, hell, really any time someone wakes up in the morning is a chance of them dying. 
So every night I cry. I mostly cry over those I’ve lost, especially my sweet baby boy who passed away on Sunday, but I also cry at the prospect of who will die next. Who will be taken from me next? When will they be taken? Will it be in a few years? In a few months? Tomorrow? sometimes I feel bad because nobody wants to hang around someone who is constantly scared of the world and constantly down. So sometimes I wish it would just be me who dies next, so nobody has to put up with me anymore, and so everyone I love can live a stress free life. People deserve so much better then what I give them, and I am nothing more then a burden in their life. So if I could take their spot in the list I would, because they deserve to live more then I do. I have always said I’d die for someone, even most of my animals, and people always chuckle like I’m joking but honestly I’m not. I realize how depressed death makes someone, so if I can prevent others from feeling that pain i would gladly offer up my insignificant life that people would not grieve over as much. 
I just wish I could be happy. For once in my life.",1

But something I've been doing is just telling myself. Whenever my mood sinks deeper and those horrible angry thoughts show up, I just think I'm not depressed. And I ignore it and ignore it until its this screaming ball in my head and then I have a breakdown. It's like part of me doesn't believe I'm depressed and constantly tries to 'reassure' myself I'm not depressed (even though I've been diagnosed) , and my other part is just wanting to cut and scratch myself until it bleeds and die.

I was on the drug Amitriptyline and i had the weirdest dreams. They were very vivid and so...weird. Years later (recently), i’ve had deja vu from those dreams. i predicted a lot of stuff and it’s kinda been freaking me out. i wrote down some of the dreams and i need to find the notes. but i swear to everything holy, i predicted stuff in my life. like situations and even trauma. i know who the “strangers” in my dreams are now. my nightmares were predicting my recent trauma stuff and im scared to tell anyone because i don’t want to sound crazy. i was taking amitriptyline then and the dreams stopped after my doctor said to not take it anymore. and i’m *pretty sure* that weird/vivid dreams and nightmares are a side effect. btw i don’t remember/ have dreams. but has this happened to anyone else??? please answer because i want to make sure i’m not losing it. thank you 💕",1

I used to only drink alcohol as a social thing. But then I realised what’s the point in being against it. I hate nearly every second of my life. The most enjoyable thing in life is sleeping. Why should I care if I’m slowly killing my brain cells. So I smoked. Now I smoke weed every couple days. Also I drink alone. And you know what. There is nothing anybody can say to get me out of it.

After that I beat the shit out of myself. I know it sounds crazy and idk why I was so compelled but I just slapped and punched the fuck out of myself and slammed my head against my bed over and over again. Strangely I feel much better now. 
I can barely see or focus on anything. I was just laying in my bed staring straight at the back of my hand completely thoughtless but painfully awake the whole time. There’s definitely something wrong with me physically because I honestly feel like I’m on drugs or something but I don’t even care. I don’t care about anything. I could and would die happily right now.

like a hot minute. We were both pretty empty and depressed but it was the only time I recall feeling any dopamine (2017). We fell apart but I latched onto it like it was my lifeline because I’ve subconsciously been using my hidden feelings for him for a few years before that as the only thing proving that i’m not a numb hollow shell, even though I was.

 Was I made to withstand the world at all, or if it was inevitable. Other people survive so many terrible things with incredible resilience. I crumbled in the face of daily life I was already depressed and broken from a young age. I can't remember not feeling like the world is full of pain and horror and there's nothing I can do about it.
I have lost that light and with it most of myself. It is often painful to live with so much feeling all the time but it was who I was, it was a part of me that I have never had. I feel I will never be whole. And this is not the legacy I wanted to leave. I think back to my mother and I wish she had never said those words to me.

test_pid_1840,"I'm done. : 31 years old, forced to move back into my parents house into a small bedroom after my fiance up and told me she didn't love me anymore.  Took the dog, the apartment, our life together.
I lasted for 6 months after that before I quit my job in January.  I'm so angry, stressed out, on edge 24/7, on the verge of alcoholism, i drink every waking moment when im at home.  now that im unemployed im basically 100% drunk at all times so this is basically my permanent state of being now.
I really just don't give a fuck.  About life, about others, about money, about success, about anything.  I am worthless and am destined to die alone because every relationship i am in winds up the same.  I have anger issues and the woman I am with, rightfully, doesn't wanna deal with that bullshit.  I blame my father because I am a carbon copy of him and I am resentful of him because of this fact. 
I am so absolutely fucking sick and tired of life kicking me in the dick and spitting on me when i'm down.  I never win.  I have never won once.  I will never win.  I am a pleb designed to be dragged through the mud of life.  Everything in my life eventually blows up in my face.  I lost my job because I got into a fist fight with some punjabi assholes in their bmw after they cut me off in a parking lot. I just snapped and started swinging.  I am pretty sure I have some sort of mental retardation because I cannot control my temper and fly off the handle way too frequently and I take everything personally.

test_pid_1842,Want to get better : I feel so shitty. I’ve felt so shitty for as long as I can remember. I have suicidal ideation and am constantly thinking about death. I notice I’m so much more cynical and negative towards myself and others and I don’t get any joy out of the things I once loved.

Every day is getting more and more unbearable.,1
test_pid_1843,"I broke my leg and I'm happy I did : Ive been depressed my whole life, ever since I can remember. probably around second grade if I had to guess is when it started. 
My parents got divorced when I was 4 and I went back and forth every day. My mom would take me to school and my dad would pick me up. At the end of the night I would go back to my mom's. I would see my mom less and less as I grew up until I was like 9. She married another guy and had kids. 
My dad was always working, he's a UPS driver. I can't remember a time of him telling me I love you. but I know he does, he shows it other ways. never affectionate. He's very overprotective too. if I did get invited to some kids birthday party he wouldn't let me go. I couldn't go outside for a walk until I was like already 18. 
I didn't really have any friends in school until probably freshman year of high school. I got bullied alot in school during and after third grade. The third day of third grade my stomach was twisting. It was horrible pain. I went home and it went away. Every day after for a couple months the same thing happened. I think I was having anxiety attacks now that I type it out lol but I don't think anyone ever told me what was going on. I was given some medicine and it helped alot, eventually I stopped taking it probably a month after. Nobody liked me since then, who wants to be friends with the fat kid who cries everyday infront of everyone. I think this was the spark to my depression. 
Ever since then I didn't really care about school. I stopped doing homework probably some time around 4th grade and completely probably stopped around 8th grade. I had zero motivation to do it. Just copied off my friends. My test scores were decent, it wasn't like I'm a moron it's just I didn't care enough to go to school. I ended up dropping out senior year. 
This whole time I'm playing video games by the way. Ever since I was 5 with my GameCube to when I was 7 with my PSP to when I was 10 with my PS3 to when I was 14 with my PS4 to my PC that I still play. My escape from my life. All day everyday, I had a problem. I would stop going to school to play video games. 
I had severe depression probably around junior year. stopped brushing my teeth everyday maybe once in a while. stopped showering every day as embarrassing as that sounds. I wouldn't let it get to a point where i could smell myself but I stopped showering everyday. 
My hygiene went to fuck, my bedroom was always a mess, I had zero motivation to clean it. I probably weighed around 240, my max. 
I started working on my life a little. I started going for walks
I got a job some how at Kohl's. Worked there for a year. During that I would walk for miles. I would walk home from work which was about 3 miles. I would go for an evening walk for a few hours everyday. I went from an XL being a little snug to a medium being a little big. over this time period. Dropped to my lowest ever, 179. I'm still depressed during this whole time but I'm forcing myself to actually do something, which was working or walking. 
I put in my two weeks because I was fed up with the drama and the verbal harassment after a year of working there. On the same day I turned in my two weeks, this girl I worked with asked for my number. let's call her Alex. I was kind of confused because I remember her mentioning her husband a couple times. 
I was so dumb with girls. One girl junior year gave me her Snapchat, number and Instagram and never texted me ever. It was so obvious she liked me, her friends were going up to me and telling me she likes me. I never made a move because i had ZERO self worth. How could a cute girl like that want me? is what I told myself. Another girl would tell me after she moved schools and came back junior year that I was the only person she remembered and gave me her number. I think she kinda told me she liked me but I'm going on. I never ended up having a girlfriend in high school. 
I end up texting the girl that gave me her number, Alex. She's 26(I'm 19 at this point)  and divorced as in moved out as of a month of her asking for my number as I find out on our first date. Gosh all the red flags are there looking back. Anyways our first date was sparks. We end up making out for a few hours. in the back of her van. We almost end up doing something but she was on her period. 
She had issues I had issues. She was depressed too. We were both not ready to be in a relationship but we were. We both found the same thing in each other, happiness. An escape? I'm not sure but man we spent a whole lotta time together. We would spend every moment we could either on the phone or with eachother. The sex was amazing. We would fuck Everytime we saw eachother. Either it would happen in a dressing room, bathroom, public, the car, her house, anywhere. We were going to have it somewhere. 
I'm still depressed at this point but it's nice to have someone to have fun with. I'm still not cleaning my room. I would only shower if I smelled or if I saw her the next day. 
I end up breaking up with her because I knew things weren't right after one year of us dating. Things were not going to last. Multiple insecurity issues on both sides, both depressed, a couple more things. 
She fucked a guy two days after. I found out after I went to her house two days after to ask her to come back to me and tell her I made a mistake ( not a mistake after all) . 
That devastated me emotionally, mentally, physically. I was just on autopilot.
Two weeks after this girl that I would spend my breaks with started really flirting with me hard. This girl is a goddess. Cute face , Nicest butt I've ever seen in person, nice body in general. I was shocked because I always saw her talking to guys, guys walking her to her car, stuff like that. btw we work at UPS and it is 50:1 male to female ratio. 
I'm an idiot, I am not ready for a relationship at all. I'm still depressed, still talking to my ex. Me and my ex were hooking up while I was talking to her.
This girl was not good for me at all. Her ex texts her on our first date and she groans. I go what's up and she says her ex is texting her. She was instantly texting back. I think she thought I was stupid or something. She would post on her Instagram story of her shaking her ass with a guy recording. But we're not together and im doing what shes doing so. anyways I took her ice skating day before Christmas eve. I broke my leg. 
I'm not at rock bottom yet. 
I'm letting this girl play with my emotions, she's posting on her story of her hanging out at a guys house almost every other day. We were talking things slow due to her. It took 11 dates for a kiss. 
I end up calling her out because I showed her this spot where you can see City lights and she post on her story with a guy there! Things end here after like 3 months of talking to each other. 
I hit rock bottom. I have a broken leg, my teeth are fucked, my room is actually terrible, soda cans everywhere. I want to do something about them but I can't since my leg. 
My broken leg was a blessing in disguise. I had time to think by myself. I got a Wax pen or whatever it's called and started smoking because what else am I suppose to do. 
I got my cast off 3 weeks ago. 
Time and weed helped me have some major realizations. I've realized that I've been depressed my whole life and didn't know it. The morning after I had that realization, I walked to the bathroom with no struggle, no thought of my leg hurting. just a pee first thing in the morning. 
That was such a huge accomplishment I started crying in the bathroom after I realized what i did. That same morning I felt like I had the power physically to clean my room and i did. It took two days but I did it. 
I bought a new bed, new nightstand, took care of the pile of clothes on bed that I neglected to fold or hang every week I wash them. I scheduled a dentist appointment for Tuesday. I started going to PT again yesterday. Went to the gym today, cleaned my car. Blocked both of those girls from everything since they still try to hit me up. I bought an electric toothbrush and I'm not hiding my smile anymore 
I feel like I've been given a second chance at life since I've gotten my cast taken off. I still feel the depression there and there could have been a few things trying to drag me down but I'm fighting, I'm fighting hard, I'm not depressed anymore for the first time in my life. I'm crying as I type this.Im scared I'm going to lose again and go back to how I was since I feel like it's so easy to but I don't want to

I was with someone for a year, and it was the only time in my “adult” life that I felt like an actual person who was worth something. we broke up a year ago. in the time since I’ve grown up a lot. got a good job that pays well, moved out of my parents house, moved into a really nice apartment in the city, where I wanted to live for a while. I lift weights for 3 hours at a time every other day, I eat healthy, only drink socially, never use any drugs. I’m doing all the things that I was told I’m supposed to do and somehow I don’t feel like I’m any closer to happiness. I’m still the same boring, timid person I’ve always been, for whom the idea of any kind of attention from an attractive girl might as well be a fantasy.
everyone fucking tells me that it doesn’t work this way. you don’t get a partner by putting all your waking effort into it. you just need to do what you like and be open and you’ll meet someone. what if I don’t want to do anything? Or what if me “doing what I like” is sitting at home, playing video games? I’m certainly not gonna fucking meet anyone doing that. And I don’t do that with any great regularity anymore, because it’s an empty fucking hobby, but that’s my honest answer. I don’t have friends. I don’t like friendships.

Everyone around me thinks depression lasts for a bit then it's gone forever, but it's not. They always say oh it'll be ok, you'll feel better tomorrow. There's always this voice constantly in my head yelling, and smothering any thoughts. People say if you smile and laugh you can't be depressed or depression is sadness. Depression isn't just being sad, you can smile and be happy. It's hard to even function during depressive episodes. Having an episode for me is feeling overloaded or numb completely, I never want to do anything, and I get so exhausted doing anything even just walking across the room. I was diagnosed mid October with clinical depression, but I've reached out to social workers and I'm feeling almost ok. Telling someone how you feel, releases such a weight off your chest, and you begin to realize it wasn't your fault for feeling the way you do, it's just a condition you have but you can feel okay if you ask for help. Yes, there are many challenges and your support system will be there for you, but you have to speak up.

test_pid_1855,"My Christian Parent: ""Your depression is caused by your lack of religion. I know how to solve your mental issues without a doctor, but you must listen to me."" : I recently opened up about my depression to one of my parents. I told them (not revealing the gender of my parent because I'm paranoid) about my depression and how these feelings are ruining my life.
Quickly this conversation turned to religion despite me not wanting to discuss it at all.
They started trying to emotionally manipulate me with claims like “you aren’t religious because you hate me” and “you’re just trying to use me as a tool to see the doctor.” A few years ago they even played the classic “I have failed as a parent” card. Gaslighting?
Eventually it got to the point where they threatened to leave the entire family if I went on anti-depressants (because supposedly I'm going to die of a brain disease if I take drugs and they don't want to go through that).
Mind you, I haven’t even gotten a diagnosis yet, nor have I even mentioned going on anti-depressants.
They‘ll gaslight (?) me during typical political and religious arguments too. “You don’t believe anything I say” and “you respect these politicians more than me.”
My parents have given me everything, so I’m feeling conflicted just writing this. I need an outside perspective to determine if this is normal or not. 
What should I do going forward? Is my parent a narcissist or something? Obviously I need to see a doctor, but I don’t want to go through threats of disownment again.",1
test_pid_1856,"Is this depression? : I’m starting to think I’ve always been depressed, but since I haven’t known anything else there isn’t any “happiness” to compare it with. I remember being very confident and sure of myself around 5 years old, but as I got older and worn down by the emotional neglect (not materialistic) of my parents, things started to become more dull and lifeless. I don’t know if I’ve been waiting for an ‘event’ to happen to bring purpose to my life, but now at 28 the only things that really excite me are spontaneous trips (booked same day sometimes only hours before) or something out of routine. (Manic?)
Day to day life is boring- I’m still finishing my degree which I think is completely worthless, and I’m obsessed with my physical well being and spend almost all of my free time in the gym. When working on the school work, it’s like I know I’m doing something that I don’t want to do so I can get a job doing something I don’t want to do. The worst part is knowing that but still doing it. I know I don’t need to finish school, but perhaps fear of being unsuccessful forever keeps us doing things that better us in theory but hold us back in reality (student loans etc.)
Current day- I’ve done some fun things, and I’ve made enough money to allow me some freedom in my current bout of unemployment. I’m good looking and don’t have any problem with women, (humble brag, but laying foundation, and pipe heheh ..jk) but the problem is I get so bored and have no desire to keep anything going. Also, sex is not worth it to me no matter how attractive the female. My friends seem to think this is really weird, but I could never have sex again and that wouldn’t really bother me much. 
All in all, I’m bored with normal life and get no joy out of anything. I don’t have that sense of purpose, passion or yearning towards the potential the future brings like I did when I was 20, and I feel like I was in a better place then than I am now. I don’t knew how to find that thing to look forward to that makes all the bullshit necessary, like “if I just grind through A I’ll end up at B in the long run” I’m also losing interest in anything that does give me joy or make me feel alive, like working out, mainly because of repetition and feeling like I’m living the same day over and over. I’m consumed by thoughts of wasting my remaining youth and time and having nothing worthwhile to show for it. I’m cynical and think my friends want to see me fail when I know that’s not true, and that goes for my family as well. 
So the question: is this depression? And if it is, how the flying fuck do I get out of this rut. I can sleep all day, and maintain my physical health based solely on my complete vanity and worry of aging like shit, but can’t really be bothered to do much of anything else. Also, my body is super stiff and for some reason my walk feels unnatural if that means anything. Lastly, I’m not sure if I have ADD or not, but I can’t really focus on shit unless I’m just starting a new project. After the initial excitement and thoughts of what could come I quickly lose any ability to complete a task. 
That said, I’ve tried Adderal 20mg and put simply, it made me feel like the person I actually want to be. I was confident about my ideas, and my mind felt like it was on my side for once. I haven’t tried it again, but it felt like it momentarily connected something in my brain that was just lacking. I don’t have the mental quickness I used to have and it feels like I have to put in effort to maintain any kind of conversation. Coupled with mild social anxiety (feels like nobody really wants me around which reflects in my body language and makes me appear like I’m angry or standoffish) but the people who actually know me would have no idea. 
Also, if it matters. I have a decently large instagram following which forces me to feel like I have to constantly meet and maintain a certain standard of life and appearance in order to keep up with the world. I can’t imagine this helps.

test_pid_1860,"How I'm feeling about myself lately : IDK if r/depression is the right subreddit for this post but if there is an r/selfloathing i doubt it gets much action. 
I don't feel good about myself lately at all. I am a 30 year old student who started community college at 21 and am going to graduate this year at 31. It's because I am, and always have been, a terrible student who doesn't study and sometimes even cheats with things like chegg and quizlet etc. I did have good grades but then last summer I fked up on a class and just didn't do the work and got an F, and now in another class I'm going to just BARELY squeak by with a D (can you believe that's considered passing??). Fortunately, my GPA will still be high enough for me to graduate and I already have a decent full timejob in my field so I don't think it really matters. 
However, I feel like a total loser. You hear all these nice inspiration stories of people who hit rock bottom and then got clean and now are straight A students graduating with honors, or single moms who work full time and still manage to keep a 4.0 or whatever like that. Well that's not me at all and I actually have a pretty cushy life (no kids, supportive family, reliable housing, enough money, etc) however I am still barely getting by in my ""accomplishments"". I don't really think Im' very good at much at all except maybe being compassionate which I think is a very good thing however that ONE THING doesn't do a whole lot when I'm bad at everything else. 
I had to tell my BF and my mom about me barely passing this class incase I didn't actually pass, because that would put graduating back a whole year (yikes). I'm humiliated and I feel like I've let everyone down by being mediocre at best. I've become super, super sensitive to anything that could be construed as criticism and I think that' sjust because my self esteem is in the toilet. 
Unrelated win: finally got off Effexor after months of dosing down and I'm glad it's finally over. 
Love you all so much and I'm so thankful there is a place like this where I can say what I want to say without fear of being judged really because none of you will ever know who I am plus we're all going through some shit so I think that makes us a bit more sympathetic than others.",1
test_pid_1861,"Numb : I can't remember a time when I was happy. I have been bullied through out my whole school life both physical and mental abuse. I feel numb the second I wake up every day, I have 0 motivation unless I'm having a manic episode, even then it only lasts a couple days before something triggers me to fall back in. In 2016 I started abusing cannabis and eventually ended up doing Xanax, lsd, shrooms, MDMA and DMT. I can't really remember those years now but I have stopped doing everything except cannabis. I have also been a daily smoker for most of the time between then and now, Cannabis is more of a coping mechanism for me now because if I have a bad day I go home and smoke it till I can't keep my eyes open. I've had suicidal thoughts before but never really did anything to try and kill myself. I have put my life in danger through being intoxicated and driving recklessly. 
I can't really sleep anymore I get like a maximum of 6 hours but most of the time a couple of hours. I have never really had any relationships thought my life resulting in me being 19 and still a virgin. I would like to have someone to fall in love with but I don't think that will ever happen, I'm so damaged that I can't even say I love you to family members. I currently live alone and have a full time job working for my parents. I don't really leave my house unless my only friend begs me to go out with him, even then I end up hating myself once I get home. I really hate myself and my life but won't do anything to help myself as I'm scared of admitting my feelings to anyone I know.

test_pid_1866,"Everyday Feels A Little More Pointless : I just don’t know what to do anymore. I have nothing to look forward to. And even when I do feelings of inadequacy still pop up. Wether it be cause of my own stupid mind making up things to be upset about or someone saying something that sparks more negativity. I just can’t seem to climb out of whatever pit this is I’ve fallen into. I’m tired ALL the time, I’ve grown bitter of socializing, especially because I know the people I socialize with for the most part don’t really care about me when it boils down to it. I’m sad all the time. Even when I’m happy, I’m sad. Because I know those moments of happiness will be completely forgotten by tomorrow. All the reasons to be joyous will be over in an instant.
Like I said, I have nothing to look forward to. I WAS looking forward to attending a concert in Chicago in June, but I’m pretty sure that won’t be happening now due to the coronavirus. The band already cancelled the tour for their home country due to it, and it’s getting worse over here too. So yeah. Looking like the whole tour is gonna end up cancelled soon enough. So much for that. I completely respect their decision if they do cancel, but that only solidifies the fact I shouldn’t get excited for anything. This is why I don’t. Because in the end, I’m disappointed. Always. I honestly should stop looking forward to anything and everything. And at this point, I pretty much have. 
Life just isn’t something worth enjoying in my eyes. It’s pointless. Everyday I wake up and wonder why I even bothered to. Everyday I feel like I shouldn’t even be here. Everyday I want it all to just end completely. And I get more and more reasons to feel that way. I want to go to sleep and never wake up. Truly. That would be the only favor the world could ever/has ever done for me.
Just let me be gone. For good. Please. Remember when I said I had nothing to look forward to? Well I lied. It all being over, once and for all, is the only thing I truly look forward to. I genuinely don’t fear dying, I embrace the thought. Not trying to sound poetic or whatever. Just stating how I truly feel.

it sucks that dad's business went to shit. it sucks that i had to drop classes to keep up with work and this depression thing. it sucks that she broke up with me because this depression shit was too much for her to handle. i was too much of a burden i guess. i feel bad when friends try to help me too, but i push them away. i just want to be alone for some reason. being alone makes me feel, better?.. more comfortable? i dont know.
i feel bad when my two friends surprised me at my house with icecream and to just spend time with me, and i wanted them to leave. i just got off work and i wanted to be alone. i wanted to scream at them to get the fuck out of my house but that would hurt their feelings. i dont know why im like this. its so weird. why am i just, improperly wired? thats just depression i guess. crazy.
i finally know why people kill themselves over this depression shit. it really is miserable. you feel worthless, but cant do shit. im not at the point where i want to just kill myself, and hopefully it stays that way. but i have had negative thoughts about it, where i would think like ""hm it would be easier to just die.""

test_pid_1899,"Should I straight up sit my family down and tell them I don’t know how much longer of the fight I have in me? (Thoughts &amp; opinions please) : I’ve been dealing with GAD/OCD since a kid.  The depression hit at 21.  I tried meds for the first time and it changed my life for four months.  I went off not understanding the nature of ADs and that they were fixing your brain for the time you’re on them.  I had a year where I was good and told myself to always remember what it felt like being pulled out of that pit and how irrationally I was thinking (will it seemed completely logical depressed).  I sank bank the following year.  I immediately sought therapy and see a wonderfulllll psychotherapist.  It’s been 6 years and none of the meds have worked.  I tried the same one, and followed up with SSRIs/SNRIs, and mood stabilizers.  My journal entries haven’t changed much in all this time.  I am a shell of what I used to be.. truly.  
I am enrolled in a clinical trial for Psilocybin which I haven’t heard back from in months now since they had to change their guidelines.  But if this doesn’t pull through or doesn’t work, I am feeling boxed in and on my last legs.  I have done bloodwork for odd things all out of pocket just to see if there was any imbalances, etc. and it all comes back great.  I cannot picture another 20,30,40 years of this.  
Since I was 21 my goal has always been to just make it to 30.  How do you explain to people your life goal is to literally just stay alive?  I worked in a hospital on the MH floor and saw how broke the system is.  
My question is now this: do I literally sit my family down and tell them I don’t know how much longer I have left in this fight?  Do I break down how I got here?  It will shatter their hearts and mine, but I think it’s justifiable. Or is it cruel?What else is cruel is just disappearing into the night and them always having questions about why I did what I did.  
I am not actively planning this right now, but know it’s inevitable unless a miracle comes.  I played 10 years of football and was a notorious hitter and wonder if that also plays a role (I am a brain donor to the Boston CTE brain bank in the case of something happening to me randomly).  
Neither of my parents are depressives and it kills them to see what a toll my issues have always taken on me.  They understand it’s a real issue but cannot relate.  They are supportive.  Them and my siblings are the only reasons I am still here.
I really want to sit them down and break down how I’ve actually tried and taken the necessary steps.  How I have 4-5 things I want to try, but if those things too don’t pan out then... to inevitable brace for it in time.  I feel so cruel just writing that, but I think they deserve to know.

test_pid_1900,"Brain refuses to be happy : Around 5 months ago, a 3 year relationship of mine ended pretty shitly, but my life is great. I’ve got friends and family that are extremely supportive, I’m doing well at the degree I want and my future is, honestly, pretty solid. But every fucking day, I wake up with this heavy feeling in my chest, that it’s all pointless and meaningless. I feel like I have to constantly fight this bitter nihilism every second and it’s making me feel very miserable inside. 
I can’t tell if it’s the breakup or I might just be depressed (come to think of it I’ve never been really happy for the past 22 years) or maybe even both. But sometimes it’s literally unbearable. I’ve tried to kill myself three times within the last 5 months but the third one realising that I just can’t do it (dw I won’t try anymore).

Just to go through all the bs life throws my way, low self esteem, no confidence, no friends, no family to seek advice from...only two over protective parents that never gave me any useful life advice...always told to be quiet and respectful to speak when spoken to...feeling like an idiot my entire life because I question if something is wrong with me...why do people I know live life so happy, like they've figured something I haven't...what's the point of being alive if all you do is work and deal with problems...problems that will keep on happening long after you're gone, like if there is a God where do I have to go to seek guidance because I feel so lost that I'm scared to keep living just to potentially end up homeless and begging, being taken advantage of...how many times do I need to pray, or curse until I get help to fix my life and just quite being anxious and stressed all the damn time! I'm so tired...I'm so scared...I'm sad all the time because I can't keep anyone close, my friendships always fade away and I'm just left with my thoughts...just worries, every single day...just keep wishing I'd fall asleep but don't get to wake up ever again...would God judge me?

I wake up go to school or work, work out most days to ward off the insecurity and avoid being truly alone with my thoughts and do little else outside of that
I've tried more time in nature (hiking), I've tried meds and or diet/exercise, I practice mindfulness and some meditation, I commit myself wholeheartedly into my work and serving others, I reach out and support any who know me and need a hand or reassurance or just someone to turn to, I have been TRYING. I have been working on me for a solid two years now to where I feel I've conquered my true demons BUT the negativity, the self-doubt, the self-hatred, the apprehension with being vulnerable are still there...and I truly dont know how to shake them. I was managing it and felt like I was doing marginally better and then I got fucking ""burned"" again and naturally now I'm burnt out again
I can feel the urge to lash out at those close to me coming back, I can feel the urge to just quit, I can feel the desire to just give up for good and that thought haunts me. I always say I would never do it but every lost friend, every stressful day, every heartbreak just pushes me closer and fucking closer
I cant fucking do it anymore...I'm not strong enough. I drove around from about midnight to now almost 6 am tonight (I guess this morning) just trying to shake the pain...trhing to avoid going home laying in bed and being alone with my thoughts...no one I reached out to answered no one ever seems to be there

test_pid_1904,"Why am I still here? : rant: unfortunately, i’ve been sad most of the memorable parts of me life. Yeah i’ve felt moments of joy, but even in those moments or shortly after, this darkness takes over. Even as a kid everything seemed so much darker and lonely than it should have. Medicine hasn’t been working, and it’s been just over a year since I got out of a hospital and all my fun diagnoses, and only several months since i stopped a spiral of substance abuse and self harm. I’ve at least gotten control of impulsivity down, but mainly because I just don’t want to end up back in a hospital and fussed over, and unfortunately i’m not going to lie, substance abuse and self harm was so much easier than dealing with what I feel, because it was at least one way to get out of my head, even temporarily. I keep trying to fake being fine to everyone, but even then I always feel alone. Even when I’m surrounded by people I care about, I feel alone. I don’t think it’s worth living every day of my life feeling so helpless and miserable. I even feel like I’m wasting my time finishing college. I want to be an art teacher so I can connect to and help kids that were like me in high school and younger, who have no one to help them work through traumas and feelings. But what help can I really be if I can’t even help myself? I feel like i’ll be lying to them if I say it gets better. So what’s the point, I can’t save anyone, not even myself. I guess I’m still around because that’s just what I’m supposed to be doing and so I won’t disappoint my family. I’m even in a new relationship that seems healthy and the complete opposite of my first relationship over a year ago. but in the end I can’t help but overthink that it’s just a matter of time before they leave too, and I feel that no one could ever love me that much, because I can’t get past stupid trauma from guys in the past. I was already depressed before crap happened, but i guess that’s what i get going to the first person who acted like they wanted to be there for me. spoiler: he didn’t actually want to be there for me. I feel gross, objectified, useless, and broken, and unfortunately those feelings got worse when I learned the hard way that most guys, at least in my experience, aren’t actually gentlemen and moral, and will take advantage of you and your feelings. I’ve had really bad body image issues for years, and I know it’s because of that stuff. I take vyvanse for ADHD(one of the many things wrong with me), and it’s honestly really wearing me down, but i don’t want to stop taking it because it’s the only thing that makes me feel skinnier and hate myself less. I know it’s a bad way to live, but I still can’t control how I feel and learn to love myself or feel beautiful, and despite being aware of my feelings and why they are there, and that they are unnecessary, I can’t change the fact that they won’t leave. I know i’m a human with issues and emotions, but i’m just tired of feeling so exhausted and drained all the time. One thing that would help would be for someone to hold me and comfort me and be there no matter what and not take advantage of me, but here I am, alone. i need to learn how to be fine on my own, and how to want to, because i’ve learned the hard way you can’t count on anyone except yourself, and i just need to grow the hell up. you can’t always just go running back to mommy or rely on a relationship. I get that i’m young and immature and unstable and have a lot of growing up to do, but i don’t want to. imagine the feeling of really wanting to go home, where you’re comfortable and able to relax, but nowhere is home, so you’re just stuck there, constantly craving an escape. I feel like I’m being forced to exist with no way out that doesn’t cause others damage. also that’s why I’m here, posting on a community of strangers, because I don’t have anyone to vent to, and I’m sitting here trying to write down whatever’s in my head instead of relapsing and turning to old habits.

test_pid_1907,"Day 1 of talking about my depression : There is a fairly large portion of people in society who don't take depression seriously , it seems unfair that those who suffer are the victims and don't get the help they need because of thos people in society judging them so starting from today I have decided to talk about my depression in order to not only help myself as I was 'classed' as a suicidal person which is fairly true but I also want to help those who suffer and dont let anyone know.
Day 1: The truth is told 
If I am asked to recall how long I've depressed I would usually say around 6 months but in reality it's close to 10 years , what people realise is that when they talk once they say something it's very difficult to take it back and 1 word even can destroy a individual's emotions no matter how its phrased. I was lucky I said "" I wanted to die"" while in school otherwise I'm scared I might've gone through with it and I was very lucky to have a supportive friend who has been through something similar and then all the people I trust aswell trying to help confidence , I've spent around 3/4 of my life inside as I suffer from anxiety so I'm scared of being alone in this world.
People can be heartless creatures who don't give a dam about ones feelings.This is because is society thos who want to be popular for their own gain are the ones who are cold to everyone else because in society if you have looks u have a chance to speak. 
People who are under the age of 18 are only just starting to get a voice, human kind has been around for more than 10,000 years and only within the last 20 years our plea for help is being heard because of the geniuses who find ways to make our voice heard 
I like photography it's a way for me to feel free because it allows be to see the beauty in things people dont really see but if u look closer even the ugliest of places can be beautiful. I appreciate that there are people in my life who want to support me and do so but I want to help make a difference in our society we get classed as people with disorders and every who gets called is essentially getting called and outcast of society and that we dont belong in it because we are different. But different better right?",1
test_pid_1908,"I just need to type right now instead of thinking about how to kill myself : 47yo. Fucked up my life. Professionally I'm ok. Everything else a disaster. Lost all my friends over the years, havent been in a relationship in many years. I spent an ungodly amount of time alone. Isolated. Sticking my head in the sand with my problems because I didn't know how to handle them by myself.
 Finally started going a therapist last week and turns out I have borderline personality disorder. Most likely from a life of no one giving a fuck about me including my family.
Now my dad is dying from cancer (which showed up in my brother 2 years ago) and now I have a spot on my shoulder that looks just like the marks on my dad. I have such low self esteem I rarely look at myself in the mirror and this mark was a speck 6 months ago. Just looked last night for the first time and instead of going away it's bigger. I'm freaking out about this more than anything at the moment. 
I'm might have an insane tax problem (that was out of ignorance if it's true, not intentional) and I cant even find anyone to help me with that.
I barely have 1 friend who I rarely see. 
I had such high expectations for my life and I sat and watched the years go by instead of achieving my goals of a wife and kids and a career I loved. Instead it's 6:30am and Im totally alone and havent even talked to a human in days which is the norm.
I'm living a solitary confinement life with an internet connection.
I want to end myself but I'm scared because I know it's permanent. I don't get to come back 100 years from now and try again. At the same time I honestly want to die more than anything. I cant keep fighting anymore when I have nothing to live for at all. 
People can reply here or I can call a hotline (even a social worker who was calling me consistently after I told her my story just stopped calling when she knew I didn't have anyone else. She hasn't called me since I started the therapist).

I should start from where i was elementary school kid. I was lazy and naive and kind of pathetic. I didn’t study, did not prepare 
Things i should do(like homework), and ignored by other people in school. I was dirty too. 
The problem is i did not fix til these days, and i don’t know what to fix and how to fix my life. To make a reason for this, i have had serious anxiety since i was 11, and have been bullied by kids. I was seriously bullied that the pain still keeps following me til these days and sometimes i want a revenge. I made a post about this on r/confession but taken down. I think it is due to violent title. 
But on the other hand, i was bully too when i was elementary school kid. And sometimes I’ve done some horrible things til this day. I want to apologize for what I’ve done and i deserve the guilty now. It feels like my heart being stabbed.
The problem is almost all i think in my life is about these things and i am suffering from it. Depression allied my past thought and they are killing me slowly. But the reality is worse. I have nothing to be good at, and want nothing to do. My father soon retired at the job but all i do is getting more pathetic and having more and more self pity. Everything seems to be negative.

test_pid_1912,"I'm suffering from incredible stupidity causing my depression, but if I tell anybody I'll be in for a guaranteed horrible experience : Please don't say ""but you can type this message"" because autocorrect has fixed every word for me.
I am stupid. Very very very stupid, like people 30 years younger than me are smarter at basic things than me, and more aware of the world. I have no friends, no local family, no respect from my family, no talents, no achievements, I failed most of my education, and I can't work because I'm physically unwell with a breathing difficulty.
Unfortunately my GP has always thought my breathing is due to ""just stress"" despite them testing for other things that prove a physical cause. As a result, I was locked in a mental hospital and only got out when my mother was passing away. It was the worst experience of my life and taught me to never actually admit to being stressed or depressed if it ever truly happened.
Fast forward to today and its happening. Whether its daily life, playing games, finding love or even tying my shoes, I still fail at everything. I was even fired from a voluntary job. People still bully me in the streets for everything about myself at age 31. I took an IQ test that only proves further how stupid I am. Everything adding up at once means I now actually do suffer from depression, unlike before. Unfortunately if I admit this to anybody, especially my family or gp, they'll put me back in the mental hospital. This isn't just paranoia, many doctors keep telling me I belong there thinking I'm just making up my breathing difficulties. I promise on my mother's grave my troubles are real and proven, but nobody will listen.

Some good influences are to thank for that. But I feel worse than ever..I've even lost my sense of humour.. I don't see the reason why I feel this way. .but the academic pressure as well as worry about my future gets to me. The fact I'll lead a thoroughly mediocre life is absolutely disheartening. And the only solace is the fact that time passes by so soon and life will be over before we know it. 
And don't even get me started on my anxiety. I wake up with palpitations sometimes and have to calm myself down thinking it's not all that bad. And theres no substantial reason to feel this way too. My faith is the only thing that's kept me going so far and praying definitely helps but the days I miss out on doing that makes me feel like I'm undeserving of god's  help.

I am a 14 yo male and | always had lots of good friends and was really good at school. At least until about 3 years ago. I switched to a new school and lost all my friends, because they stayed at my old school. I got to know a dude(l'll call him A) that was in my class and we got best friends. That year my grades suddenly got really bad and | forgot a lot of homeworks. My math teacher was not that nice and some people in my class (including me) were really scared of her. I got bullied, got only one to two friends and my grades were bad. All of that lead to my depression. At least I had A as mental support. Some time passed and the relationship between me and my parents got worse, because they were getting calls from my teachers about my bad grades. To all of that I had an argument with A. l can't remember what it was about but now he doesn't really like me anymore, which really hurts because I have known him for a few year now and | always considered him as my best friend.

test_pid_1921,"39, with 30 years of night. : I walk at night. Not to one place or another, just around. I used to climb the fence to the cemetery near my house, but I'm not a kid anymore and it would look too weird to anyone that spotted me. I used to though, and it was nice in there.  
Now I walk down to a channel that runs through my college town. It's nice but homeless people call out in the dark, lost in their own issues and drug altered states of mind. It's not dangerous. The homeless are almost always afraid, even the ones that act aggressive when you surprise them. Most of them know me now, not my name but because they've seen me there, down by the water, lumbering along like a tall ghost. One of them slowly raises his hand when he sees me. I raise my hand in return - a slow greeting and goodbye in a single, wordless gesture.  
I have it good. There's no reason for these long hushed walks. I'm comfortable in life. My girl is a saint, my parents are loving. Nothing damaging, beyond what life takes from all of us, has happened to me. I used to talk about the night walk, the depression, but I eventually found that no one had a cure, no one could comfort the human condition. So I stopped letting others know. My parents talk about my depression in the past tense, which I prefer. Allowing them to think it was just a short term issue makes me feel good, as if I'm preforming a service, just letting them go on without worry. I owe them at least that much.
I've tried drug, legal and illegal, in an attempt to sooth my mind, or shift it to a lighter setting, but not change that core aspect of me. The philosophy held out against a hazmat truck-load of alcohol, psychedelics, uppers, pills, and balls-to-the-wall adrenaline doses that would split a lions heart in two. It didn't change anything, except making stand-up comedy better. If you haven't tried drugs, just know they wont fix anything. I never got addicted to any of it, only gained the knowledge that drugs are a temporary alteration and even hallucinating that your brain is in control of the flight patterns of migratory birds gets to be a calm sort of normal after a while.

test_pid_1924,"I tried to kill myself on Monday night. For the first time ever, I didn't chicken out or try to seek help. It didn't work. Not sure where to go from here. : I've made a bunch of suicide attempts over the past 13 years, but usually I chicken out by telling someone and/or going to a hospital. This was the first attempt I've made in 4 years, and I didn't stop myself. I looked up the lethal dose for the pills then took twice that. I felt so happy, so relieved. Finally, my life would be over.
But instead, I spent that entire night in an excruciating amount of pain, curled up by the toilet, puking my guts out until all I had left to vomit was my stomach bile. In the morning, I finally stopped throwing that up too.
I called in sick to work and told them I had the flu. My boss wasn't thrilled with me because I was supposed to be in at 8am and didn't email her until 1pm. But she said she was mainly worried, because it was so unlike me. Three of my coworkers texted me to see if I was okay. I wasn't expecting that, I didn't realize they actually cared.
I had a call with my therapist yesterday, and I didn't tell him. I told him that my mental health has tanked, and that I was sick in bed with the flu. And without knowing what I'd already done, he said he was worried about my mental state and asked if I had suicidal thoughts. I told him I did, but that I hadn't settled on a good method for suicide yet, so he had nothing to worry about. That's true, I guess.
I still don't have a good method. I still don't want to live. But I also can't even think about attempting again right now. As I waited for the pills to take effect, I knew that I would have stomach problems so I chewed on candied ginger and drank chamomile tea. Now I can't smell either without getting nauseous.
For others who have gone through with an unsuccessful suicide attempt, what did you do next? I don't necessarily mean in terms of executing a plan, I just mean like in life. Do you just go back to work once the physical side-effects have worn off and pretend like everything's fine? Did you do something drastic like buy a plane ticket and pack up your shit? Or do you quit your job and turn into even more of a hermit?
Before you suggest it, I'm not going to tell anyone in real life what I've done. I can't put my friends and family through this shit again, not unless it's finally over.",1
test_pid_1925,"Friends.. maybe? I don't wanna give up. : I don't really know what so say here.. after reading some posts I feel like nobody would care for another ranting post around here. \^\^'  
Well.. it is the first time for me to really reach out for someone or something via text so I have no idea how it turns out.. but we all here, who write these texts about us, show that even if we say we have given up already, that some parts of us are fighting against it. Otherwise we would not even bother to post something here.   
I thought I could mention my fu\*\*ed up past, but I know we all had our share of troubles and our package to carry..   
I just feel like.. that I cannot carry mine alone anymore.   
I am Tom. I am 25 and probably in depression since I was 16 years old. But 2 month ago I finally found the courage to go to the doc and sort stuff out and arrange a therapy.   
To give you the basics of me here the following:  
Around 3 years ago I had to give up my own appartment because the friends I was living with betrayed me money wise. First they used to live with me for years without paying rent. Then when I said I couldn't hold up anymore for the 3 of us they guaranteed me that they support me and pay rent at least. In the end they both left me with 3k debt ( each ) that they never payed back and left before the ship sank, leaving me ( the captain in this metaphor ) to sink with the appartment. Why I did not do something about it earlier was simply because I was living there with them since I was 16. I was lonely.. I felt absolutely the need to have someone around even if they didn't care. More like I put puppets in my puppet house so at least it feels lively. At least the light is on when I came home right?..   
Well so after this happened an old childhood friend picked me up, let me move in together with her and gave me the chance to fix up stuff again. But in a new city, without any friends, quitting my job in the moving process and kinda lost motivation and sight of what would give me progress I fell into a hole I couldn't get out with anymore. I left the appartment, the people and the money behind me and tried my best to move on. Which brings me to the present..   
What I miss the most is having friends.. Having someone to talk to. Share interests. Play games together. Watch anime or whatever. But being 25 now.. feels like I am so god da\*\* old already that all the connections a teenager has to push up his social life just dont work anymore for me. Or at least I feel completely out of place and totally weird when I attempt to meet other people, go out etc. Which makes me only leave the appartment for appointments, or walking with my dog.   
I feel completely lost. I am way to emotionally unstable currently, pretty much crying whenever my eyes and body feel like it. I still have hobbies, people to talk to, stuff to pretty much entertain me.. but these people are not real friends and all the entertainment starts to feel hollow.. But I am able to hold proper conversations. I am able to share some fun! I try my very best to not give up. **I push suicidal thoughts away for so many years already, I don't want to give up yet!!**  
Ultimately.. I think what I wanted to say is.. I am suffering from depression.. trying to avoid taking meds against it, giving my best to fight but I feel so alone that it becomes harder and harder..   
It is very hard in this situation to find friends, be it male or female and as you can guess even harder to find any females that would take interest in you..   
I would appreciate any sort of.. advice?.. I guess. Or even people approaching.. I dunno.. thank you for reading! Really..",1
test_pid_1926,"My brain is so dopamine fried that I became depressed by constantly checking my muscles after workouts and noticing I haven't gained much makes me want to stop altogether and just lay in bed. : I know this whole title sounds like a joke but I literally want to cry over this. This makes me ashamed. I fucking hate how my body looks even though it's considered ""normal"". I want to be more muscular and it's just not happening. Plus muscle imbalance is fucking with my brain too (constantly feels like my right arm is more muscular even though I try to train my left more). It's just not good looking and it bothers me so much I want to stop altogether. The sole reason I wanted to do this is to have more be adequate since girls in my class have commented on how they'd never date me (one literally blatantly said if she had to choose between me and being single she would choose to be single) All I do right now are pushups and not that many maybe 40-60 a day. Nowhere near enough to get anywhere. It just all feels so pointless but at the same time I need to do it or else I will be alone forever.

test_pid_1927,"A strange Depression. : This is a throwaway. I've much on my shoulders, I just need to get it off. And I have nobody else. I mean, NOBODY. Very first post, please be reasonable.
I've been battling this since I was 12. Folks died within a month or two apart. I was sent to live with my guardian. I have since been lost, wandering the world in search of a purpose. I am overweight, not athletic. Not good at much. I know a lot about animals though, they were always something I could let my mind delve into. I'd dream of filming all the animals across the globe. But I knew it wouldn't happen. I tend to be pessimistic. Forgive me. My guardian who raised me basically tried their best,  know they did. But they were just too old and out of the ""parenting"" game to really do much. So I was left with NO guidance. No way to determine who I'd be. Sure I had family who had taken me out for fun nights at dinners, sleepovers with cousins. The usual. But back then, it seemed to be a daze of things. I felt the world spinning around me and my little bubble, where I wouldn't escape, but I could see everything taking shape around me.
I wrote a lot, I cried, A LOT. I stayed hidden away a lot. I just tried to be happy for everyone else, because I didn't want to burden them. I went through ALL types of counseling. It seemed to dull the pain from time to time. In my adult life, I ran rampant. I didn't do drugs other than smoke some pot which helped me with anxiety. I didn't have any children (still don't). I've been married for almost 5 years to someone who has helped so much but also has issues of their own which tend to shake me. I feel like a shaken soul. Just spinning around the earth, hearing, seeing, smelling and observing all the lives amongst me. I've not genuinely given up, but I certainly have lost much hope. I do believe in God, but it's not some crazy church bullshit. I believe we are created to serve a purpose. And I don't blame God because of free will. We all have obstacles and how we choose to deal with them is what helps define us and define our character (please don't bash, I wouldn't dream of harming someone else for their beliefs. I think you should be free to explore any beliefs you should choose. That is our choice)
I'm just in this whirlwind of struggle, anger, numbness to an extent. I've thought about dying, but I don't want to till it's my body's natural time. Till I run my clock out. I couldn't dream of taking my life because there is so much beauty I do get to see, and I enjoy the happiness of others. It's about what drives me. 
But down inside, into the very core is pain. Tears, anger, hatred, and self-loathing. I am trying to fight it each day with positivity but it is never enough. I  just want to feel normal. If there is such a thing...
Sorry for the long post and it might be really spotty. I'm kinda having a dark moment here, and thoughts tend to get foggy... Thank you for reading you guys. Stay supportive of those needing the shoulder.",1
test_pid_1928,"I don't self-harm but I think of it often : Lately I have been extremely irritable to the point where minor things going wrong will worsen my mood considerably, and it's gotten to the point where I often just think of myself hurting myself, like bashing my head against a wall, punching myself in the face, stabbing myself, etc. I don't know how common this is",1

test_pid_1933,"Depression has made me superstitious : Logic always wins from what humans make up, that’s what I thought before I slipped into depression. Now I think I’m seeing things, but on the other hand, I also think they may be true, and the doubt is torture. I think people hate me, and that I’m a lower being who was born wrong, destined to suffer every day. And when things seem to go a little better, life just takes it away from me and laughs. I’ve started to believe there’s something that likes to see me suffer, likes to give me hope just to take it away again, and again, and again. Everyday pain has become normal. Wanting to isolate myself, even though I’m so lonely and I hate every moment of it, that’s also a problem.
And nothing of it matters. In the end, why would I try anything? Why would I bother writing on a digital platform where people I’ve never met or heard of are everywhere? And I got so tired of all the cheap, quick-fix advice I get, all the “exercise, sleep enough, eat healthy, live laugh love” -bullshit. If it were that easy, I’d never have been like this. I don’t even think I’m capable of being a normal person anymore. 
If I don’t go mad or put myself out of my misery, somehow, I’ll wear the scars of this for the rest of my life. So I guess, whoever read this till here, sorry for making you sad too. I didn’t mean to, and it’s unlikely his will help in any way in the end.",1
test_pid_1934,"Just another post uh? : So uhm, it will be difficult to express everything since english isn't my mother tongue but I'll try.
For starters, I'm a young lad from Italy and right now, my whole country is in a lockdown to the recently covid-19. At the beginning of it, I didn't care much since I don't have an active social life but, this morning out of the blue, a panic attack came.  
Needlessy to say that my mind gave me a hard time, I kid you not, I could hear literally a bunch of voices screaming and whispering phrases such as: ""What if the whole world will collapse because of this pandemic"" or ""What if your country doesn't get back on track?"".  
Of course, this wasn't the first time I had a panic attack, the record history goes back to early 2013 when I first fell into this black void of emotions and despair.   
In that year I had countless problems such as: my parents executive eviction from the house where I grew up (0-13 years). My ex classroom was full of bullies which made going to school a living hell every day.   
Shortly after I began to cut myself up, in many ways. It was my only coping method for the pain I felt on a daily basis and somehow, I've considered this as some sort of punishment for being myself.  
The only brighter side was my best friend, I owe her a lot since she was always there for me: when I wanted badly to end my life or just the bad moments.
But of course, nothing good lasts in my life. We argued at some point because I was uncapable of showing affection. (flaw that came back a few years later, when I got engaged. Same issue, same end)
I pushed her as I'm pushing my few friends to hate me to sweeeten the goodbye but it didn't worked.   
She left and in that period I was all alone so I took a really bad decision.  
Dropping out of school.
At the start it seemed good for my mental health but right now, it's coming back to bite me since I didn't graduate. Finding jobs in Italy isn't a piece of cake and even the graduates can't find a proper job, so how could I? I don't know if our economy will be back enough to grant me something since I'm a weight for my sister and brother.
I won't mention my parents because they are from a really old generation and lemme say this: some couple aren't suitable for raising children.
My brother keeps entrusting me of looking out for them and as a son, it doesn't bother me. It's my way of compensate for having a roof upon my head (italian figure of speech) and my sister, is paying my internet connection, monthly. This is the worst part, knowing that she has a family of her own and I'm here, literally asking for money. (It's not a lot but...you know even 1 dollar/euro would weight on me)  
Returning on the main topic; the attack was also caused by my immagination of the future for my nephews and nieces. Since we all know what the global warming and pollution are doing to our planet I'm fucking scared. I don't care about me, never did but when they came into my life I've started looking out for them. They're my pride and joy, absolutely. 
Thinking of the future is haunting, I don't have any particular skills, I'm not good at anything. I'm a really mediocre  person, maybe even low than the average human being, but mostly, I'm a f\*\*king walking failure.
I'm spending most of my nights awake and thinking of the same things that pursue me from 7 years ago. Reminding of every little mistake I've made in my life. I'm young and I should enjoying these years (another figure of speech) but I don't have pleasent memories and I'm just full of regrets.
I'm a mess and at this point, crying doesn't help me anymore. I did everything wrong and I want another chance at life but that is just pure fantasy.
I don't know what I should be doing right now internet. I'm wasting time by the time. 
I don't know.",1

I think my family will be sad but they'll just go 'oh well' and move on. People I used to be friends with will do the same.

I’ve been feeling pretty depressed for a good 2 years at this point, and had gotten pretty good at hiding it. 
But then lately I’ve been having anxiety/panic attack-type things, and I could tell that my mental health was slowly deteriorating from how shitty it was before, but I was still trying to lie when people asked if I was okay, smile when I wanted to break down and cry. 
However, I had an anxiety/panic attack today in my 6th period, but I was able to calm myself down enough and be reasonably stable, so I just went on to my next class (band). But then something in me just kinda snapped. The band director told us to do a test (play a part of a piece we have by yourself) and he had not mentioned this since yesterday, and I tried to ask him a question, which should be easy because I’m a flute and in the front row, right? Right?? Fucking wrong. I kept getting spoken over by other people, people were asking me questions, it was so loud, and I just kinda snapped. I started having another panic/anxiety attack and was hyperventilating, but then this freaking god that is the first-chair flute asked if I was okay and said that I could go to the bathroom and calm down and that she would tell the BD why, thank god for her. 
So I went into the bathroom for the rest of the class period, still fucking dying. And long-story short, I went to my last period, feeling awful, sat down and started hyperventilating once more because the room was so damn loud and I had a headache already and people are jerks, the teacher saw me and took me to the councilor, the councilor called my mom, and now I’m going to the doctor tomorrow to talk about getting therapy. 
I’m a little spooked to go to therapy, but it seems to have worked for everyone I know for the most part, so yeah.",1

test_pid_1970,"I’m breaking. Please. Help : Bear with me this is a bit of a long story. Im a 15 year old girl from urban Georgia who’s goes to a fairly prestigious high school.
I wouldn’t say my life was particularly tough growing up...except the past few years. In the past few years I’ve had to leave my 9 year long friends and go to a different school, form new friendships, only for them to be broken again when I had to go to another new school because my parents believed it was best. In 7th grade(first year at school number 3) I found out that my mother had developed a drinking problem and had started abusing my father, who never hit her back even though all her abuse. It shook me to my core that someone I trusted so much could simply turn into a monster...I was and still am scared of her. I became withdrawn socially because run my mind “why should I trust more random people around me when they will either leave me behind or could become like my mother.” I fell into a depressive state. I would dig my nails into my wrist to stop myself from crying everyday. Every night I was up til midnight or later, listening to my mother yell at my father for thing he had never done, hearing her throw all sorts of shit against the walls, and finding dents in the morning. I lived in constant fear basically, but 8th grade was when I hit rock bottom. My mother abuse became more physical, she threw a large lamp at him, slapped him in the face with shaving cream when he was sleeping, threw and broke multiply glasses, and scratched whore into the side of two of our cars...one of which I’ll be driving. She had accused him of sleeping with a much MUCH younger co-worker (she was like 20 and he’s in his late forties) which she had no evidence nor reason to believe, because whenever I asked her why she thought that she just said “he is”. She also became a bit abusive towards me, yelling at me for minor things. I became a soulless empty husk all of 8th grade. I honestly don’t remember much since I was a walking mindless zombie. I considered suicide multiply times that year, even thinking about the most painless and quick way to do it. There was a night I was so close to doing it but didn’t have the guts to leave my old sister and father who I both loved so much, behind. I continued to dig my nail into my arm, I started punching my leg and or banging my head on a wall when I was in a bad state. I also started cutting up my arm with my nails, which were pretty long and once cut my leg up with an exacto knife...I hated everything about myself, I couldn’t look myself in the mirror with out sobbing, I had a 2-3 supportive friends at dance, but no one at school had any idea. I faked a quiet smile throughout the whole year. I stopped going to lunch and at a snack in the bathroom. I became unable to handle being in crowds or loud noises (because of my moms yelling I’ve also developed a fear of yelling and have to calm myself down). 
Beginning 9th grade I slowly started to get better, I began talking to and reaching out to a bit more people at school, which was pretty difficult and took many tries to even speak to others. My sister realized what was going on and had been helping me, I got a bit closer with my sister close friends too. I still struggled at feeling useless and I hated watching myself dance even though I’m at a pre professional level, I forgot to mention earlier but I dance 5-6 days a week 9am-5pm on Saturdays and am a soloist in my student company, but i have become a bit more comfortable with my looks. I’ve remember the first time I genuinely laughed since 7th grade. I wasn’t close friends with anyone at school but I felt more comfortable commenting on people’s posts and texting them to ask questions. I stopped letting people take advantage of me ( people would ask for me to buy them food and then be like “omg you are so my best friend thank you so much!!” ). I’m still healing and have many scars. My father snapped and told me mother he wants a divorce, he attitude changed completely once she realized he was serious, because she knew I would want to go with him and she cleaned up her act trying to act all nice and buy me things so I would break him more than she ever could but I didn’t and simply pushed back at her. I’m no longer scared of my mother, she’s raise me to be intelligent which sucks for her cause I now can fight back with legitimate facts and reason, I can now stand up for myself and am not afraid to yell at her at the top of my lungs. I would say I’m okay. But I’m not.
My sister is leaving for collage and I’m scared since she has been my main support leg. My dance studio is falling apart and all three of my other support legs, my best friends in the world. Are ll moving away to pursue dance at a non toxic studio( whole different story there ). I’m getting shaken up again because like I said earlier, I have a bit of a fear of people leaving me behind, and all my support legs are slipped just as I’m trying to build new ones. I’m so scared of what’s gonna happen, I’m scared of falling back into depression, I want to live but sometimes it doesn’t seem worth it still to this day. I’m scared please help. Everything I’ve done and fought through feels like it’s crumbling and I feel like im gonna retreat back into my shell. I know this was long but I have no other place to turn to and would appreciate some advice.",1

test_pid_1972,"Parents are truly uncaring : They never gave a shit growing up because the idiots had 5 children and lived on government dole... they had too many stresses to give a fuck about the 4th accidental child. They could never talk about anything deep or educate me on anything because they are uneducated and neither of them speak very good english yet they didnt bother to teach me their language, figuring I would just 'pick it up' after they never interacted with me or conversated with me. 
They pressured me to become a doctor or engineer when neither of them can even do basic algebra and were unwilling to facilitate the environment needed to thrive academically. And they fed me like shit and my father actively stopped me from going outside because he thought our neighborhood was too dangerous. So I made no friends outside of school. And being that weird poor kid I made few friends in school as well.
Now as a 21 year old failure who had some stints in temporary jobs and ultimately never figured anything out, they don't even pretend to give a shit anymore. They were my only friends and I thought we could solve every problem together but they never wanted to work with me. They shat me out in this fucked world to suffer just like them. They never got the memo of ending the cycle of abuse. I feel utterly betrayed every day that I wake up and every day when I go to sleep. I am fairly certain I am autistic and have been accused of it many times and because I know how hard it is to forge a relationship I place a lot more importance on my existing ones. And now my 2 most important relations have shown me time and again that they do not give a shit. I think they do and want to believe they do but they don't. 
They don't even bother to talk to me anymore, if I try they come up with some shit excuse and leave the convo. They gaslight me on past conversations, they will pretend not to have said things that hurt me, even though I KNOW they did. There is no winning. I feel extremely frustrated and angry and betrayed. I see people with parents that do everything they can to give them the best life experience. I feel like I was made to simply be a slave and now that I couldnt fulfil that role, I am discarded. I used to think the Joker was stupid but now I find myself simply breaking into pained laughter at how ridiculous my life has become. I am poor as fuck and realistically I will never leave my miserable town. I am a retard, I can't even make money to get out of my parents house. I am stuck in this prison forever. The fact that it was sheer luck that gave me such a terrible starting hand, one that simply can't be played to win, is just funny.
I know not many people will read this. But I wanted to get it out there. Nobody will believe me on anything anymore. They think I am some crazed lunatic that lost it. The truth is I am just incredibly depressed. I dont care about how i look or what I say anymore. I dont care if strangers think im mad. Strangers mean jack shit compared to family and my own family threw me like trash many years ago. I honestly hate this life and I envy every person that has someone to really trust and lean on.

We're being forced into this world, into a system with rules that everybody has to follow. Because without these rules it seems, we wouldn't be able to live with other human beings. At least that's what history says. We have to go to school, learn tons of stuff where even teachers say that we won't need it after school. We need to get a job, get a partner, start a family, because that's what society expects us to do. And all of this only because two humans decidet that it'd be a great idea to have a child. People die everyday, people who wanted to live, who deserve it. But i, who desperately doesen't want to live anymore, am still here. How does that make sense?

test_pid_1979,"Should I get help : After a few weeks I finally got myself to write this. I know my back story is by far not as bad as others but I feel like writing this might make me feel better.
 When I started school I was a very open kid that liked talking to everyone. But because I annoyed them I started to get bullied. They started telling me that I don't have friends and got violent when I started to go against it. Back then I had a very good friend that moved away and I lost contact with for years. I started telling myself I didn't have friends which only made me feel worse. I was too scared to talk to people thinking they would judge me. This went on until 2 years before my graduation after that it got a lot better I made a good friend and I thought it was going good. After my graduation I started an apprenticeship (which is common in Germany) and was happy. But after a while people at school (in Germany as an apprentice you have school and go to work) started bullying me again. Although they didn't get violent the started picking on everything that I said even if there was no reason to. They just enjoyed me getting angry or sad. That threw me back into what I was feeling when I got bullied a few years before my graduation. I also heard from my friend I that I mentioned in the beginning who started dealing drugs and destroying his life also my parents prohibited me to have any contact with him. My best friend that I made before my graduation got suicidal because of some family issues which made me worry. Because of all that to feel better I started playing a lot of video games which did help and I met some nice people. Sadly a lot of them are starting to ignore me and I am blaming myself for it. I worry that people think I am weird or annoying and I am scared of losing people I like or people that I just met hating me because of something I do. I often have suicidal thoughts but I am to scared to do it cause I worry people would judge me for it. I also am to scared to tell people how I feel because I fear they will tell me that I am fine and I am just lying to myself or seaking for attantion.
It took a while for me to finally get myself to tell people about this even if it's just on reddit. I know there are a lot of people who had it way worse than me. But I am tired of always telling people I'm fine when they ask or worrying because of the way someone said something to me.
Can you please give me some advise I don't know what to do.

there society, most people will go as far as force you to live for the sake of it just because they don't like the idea of anyone dying if it's a choice on their part.
there survival instinct that prevent you from doing many things that could end your life and trying to go against it is extremly hard when it doesn't just feel straight up impossible.
there the fact that at least in my case i reject physical pain to the point of it preventing me from doing certain things like cutting my wrist in the bath or to just go for avaliable but especially painfull ways (usually go in pair with my survival instinct to make things that much easier).
there what you risk by failing if you try wich goes in pair with the lack of avaliable information/tools to safely do it wich make it harder just commit to it.
there failing in itself that (if we forget about the risk of long term damage) it make the courage you gathered go to waste and may make the way you tried impossible to attempt again for various reasons (this way may just not work for you, you may not be able to gather what you need again anytime soon if able at all, you may be watched, you may not be able to gather that courage again anytime soon, etc...).

to anyone that will basically tell me that it is imoral to let anyone kill themself, it isn't. what is imoral is to go against the free will of the people by forcing your own way of thinking on them. that said, some people don't really want to die, some just want attention, some have solutions for their problems (solutions that must be worth it to the one that want to die), some are too young to make this choice (i'm thinking the still being actively raised by their parents kind of young), some might change their mind if they just wait a bit instead of rushing it as soon as they feel like ending it and there more but the list is long already. it just mean that it's a complex subject and that no, you shouldn't let everyone kill themself but also that you absolutely shouldn't force everyone to live.",1
test_pid_1997,"I just feel empty. : I used to feel really depressed, sad, angry etc all the time, but also had moments of joy, energy and freedom. Now I just kinda feel empty. It seems like I've  forgotten how to feel emotions, passion or anything of the sort. I just exist and do what I'm  supposed to do and thats it. Im not satisfied with the way Im living but I also dont see any way to change it. I cant afford to get an education, both for money reasons and because taking care of my little one and my family on top of working and keeping the home straight consumes all my time and energy. Ive lost touch with what makes me, me. I am directionless and listless most of the time. I dont have any special talents to dig myself out of the hole im in. I want to make music but ive lost my drive to do anything creative. I barely have any appetite for life or food anymore. It feels like in just withering away. Part of me wonders if I should be on medicine again, but last time that didn't go well for me. The only thing that really has helped me without any terrible side effects is marijuana, but I dont really have the money to afford a medical card and I dont want to smoke it illegaly anymore as that could put me in hot water seeing as I have a child. Idk. Ive been drinking more lately as a way to get to sleep at night with back pain and anxiety but its not healthy and I know it only makes my depression  worse the next day. It just feels like a constant rainy day im my head. Im tired of feeling like this but I dont know what to do. I cant even afford medicine if I did go that route because I dont have medical insurance. I know I need help, I know I cant do it alone but I dont have the means to get help and that is perhaps the most depressing part. I literally cant afford to get the medical care I know I need despite working my ass off more the 45 hours a week, and I makes me feel like there is no silver lining. People talk about being depressed for days, weeks months on end. I cant remember a stretch of time lasting more than a few days when I haven't been depressed since elementary school and I'm 22.

test_pid_1998,"Why did he do it : It’s been three years since he committed suicide... Why? Why did he have to leave me here? To me he was my only real friend I have had in life even though we only worked together for six months. Every time I think back at my past, the time I spent with him is when I am the happiest. I wish, I just wish I could back just to talk to him again. He was the only person who really showed interest in me and felt like he wanted to know me. Working with him was like not even working at all. I would actually hate finishing up for the day but then get excited for the next. When he told me he was leaving I was shocked and angry so angry I put my walls up and didn’t talk to him at all during his last working week. I didn’t even say goodbye. What if I was one of the hands that pulled him into suicide? I should of told him he was my only friend and to keep in touch. That is my biggest regret I will have in my life.
Since then I have worked my way up into his position but I feel so lost and starting to a second guess myself on everything I do. To the point where I actually hate going to work because of it. I wish this was all a dream and when I open my office door he will be sitting there with a smile on his face. 
He was passionate about his work and it rubbed off on me. I feel like the passion is slowly leaving me and I feel like I want to get out of this career path. But the passion comes and goes like waves so I just don’t know and feel guilty about wanting to leave.
After hearing about what he did I decided to not to give anyone new the time of day and to keep my walls up. Because what’s the point they could leave me or even worse do what he did. 
Recently I have found someone who I can’t stop thinking about. I want to get to know her but she doesn’t seem really interested in talking me. 
What if she knows I’m a horrible person because of what happened?
It’s starting to break me, what if the feelings I have now is what he felt when working with me for that last week? 
I am a horrible person.",1
test_pid_1999,"I had a breakdown after work last night : I just started work at a warehouse job because it’s the only thing that got back to me. It was my first full day on the job and it sucked. I wasn’t meeting the quota given to me, I was doing everything wrong according to my manager. My back and knees are killing me and I had to hold back tears on the job. The entire ride home I just balled. The entire time I just felt worthless. The actively admitted to not caring about me, just making quotas and they’ll let me go if I do a bad job. I want to be more than that, just some cog, but I just feel useless. Every job I’ve had I’ve sucked at. Depression and Anxiety keep me from doing anything right it seems.
I would just leave out right, but I don’t have anything lined up for me, and I’ll mostly likely be kicked out of my house if I don’t have some kind of work. Is this all life is? Just constant anxiety and depression and people being absolute dicks? I don’t want to live like this.",1

test_pid_2006,"MDD and Life and College : First, here's some basic demographic information, just so we know who I am:
I am 22 years old. I'm from Eastern Kentucky (very southern) and attend(ed) the university of Kentucky. Finally, I'm an atheistic gay guy in a long-term relationship that includes 3 years of living together as roommates.
Now, I want to say that nothing above is really relevant. I've had crippling depression since 16, am proud of my heritage, and I have a supportive family, i.e. I'm treated as a son, not necessarily a gay son or an atheist son-- we have mutual respect for our differences.
What is relevant is that I don't know how I'm going to survive life. I am medicated and see a psychiatrist at least monthly.
I started treatment fall 2018, when I withdrew from college in order to get medications sorted/get back on track. Everything seemed to be okay, I did well last semester, and now I've had to withdraw again. I'm right back where I was a year ago. I love my program of study and my school. I'm confident that it is not the problem. At most the stress exasterbates the problem.
That being said, last week I went to a professor for help/asking for leniency to get caught up(I have a letter of accommodation and my school's disability resource center allows me to have attendance flexibility/due date flexibility). The professor refused. Okay, not a big deal, really. The issue is that he closed the door and lectured me for at least half an hour about how everybody goes through problems, about how his nephew failed out of college causing him to be depressed, and generally just underminding what a disability is. I attempted to leave twice because he brought me to tears with the berating, which also caused me to get angry. He kept telling me to sit back down. I'm a polite person, so I just didn't respond until he lectured out, then I left. He insulted my intelligence several times. To say he has a mightier than thou complex is an understatement, as I am aware and was aware that he is an intelligent individual. There was never a question. However, he knew exactly what my life problems and internal situations were, apparently. He interrupted me when he asked a question. He assumed me to be someone I'm not from the ground up, and he wouldn't let me say who I am. Apparently, I am a dumb country-boy who misses home and forsakes my responsibilities. 
I'm aware I can get him into trouble, and etc. However, I don't want to be in a class with somebody like that, so I just dropped the course. I have a full-ride scholarship, but I've officially withdrawn from the university and basically I have thrown it away. My GPA isn't in the shitter because I've been able to withdraw 3 times now. I could probably go back but it's a bad idea and I know it.
The thing is, that's not an uncommon reaction by professors, I've noticed. There are some who are absolutely amazing, and we usually set up a plan at the beginning of the semester, and there is no problem. The rest just want me to email them if anything is up. I do, then they tell me I need an excuse(rules say I don't), that they don't approve of the behavior, or outright ignore me. I've never asked for anything grandiose. It's at most extensions.
After I got out of the office with that professor, I had one of the worst breakdowns of my life. I sat in my car crying for about an hour, then pulled myself together enough to drive 5 minutes home, then isolated myself and continued wallowing. I'm not sure if it was some sort of manic decision or what, but I then decided to completely withdraw, not just his class.
I'm thinking I'm going to take time off again. I'm not sure it will end any differently, but I've decided to go to school a little closer to home- which entails probable loans, moving, and throwing away everything from before. The reason I'm choosing the school is purely logical--price and programs available. It at most shaves 30 minutes off a 3 hour drive, so I'm not sure that my impression that it's closer to home is even true, really. 
My internal dialogue says this is going to end the same way, and that I should just drive off a cliff, or whatever. I just don't know if I can trust my decision because I'm at the bottom again, and I know I make awful decisions while depressed. I just let life go and cease caring, which later creates a vicious cycle in which my previous decisions cause me to constantly try fixing everything, which is exhausting and I become depressed, rinse and repeat.
Is it a manic decision to completely uproot and move? I recently spent close to 5k in a manic decision, so I have no idea. I feel like my guiding compass is blacked out, somehow.
I really don't think school is an issue academically, but the culture may just be wrong for me. I don't know. But I've been someone with major depressive disorder since 16, so I KNOW my episodes don't always have a cause or source. It just happens. The best I can usually do is mitigate and stop it from going too far.
I am thinking I'm probably bipolar, but that's not an issue I want to think about right now. I have an appointment, and I'm sure the doctor will have an insight.
Failure used to be my worst fear. This whole thing has made me question whether I am, in fact, an unintelligent country-boy who is depressed out of convenience. I logically know that's not the case. The dark spot is just looking for doubts and guilts. 
I'm not sure what I need to do going forward at all. I have no idea where I am at in life. I have no idea how I am going to financially make it (thankfully rent is paid through August). Energetic me wants to completely reinvent myself and everything around me, fuck the cost. Depressed me can't be bothered to care. It's like I'm walking into fire intentionally. I just don't care.. At all. About anything, myself included. It's not even an evident sadness at this point. I just don't care about the consequences of everything to the point I'm willing to just sabotage everything, I think. 
It's really hard to explain, and school is really only an example, and there are a lot of details being left by the wayside, of course. 
I'm not really sure what I'm asking of you, fellow redditors. This is somewhat a vent, and somewhat an open-ended question. What do you think, I guess?

test_pid_2010,"I feel like I have no one... : (I’m on mobile, sorry in advance for formatting). 
So, I’m currently pregnant (33 weeks) and these past few months have been hell mentally. I was in a VERY dark place for quite a while up until around the first part of February - I felt little to no connection to the baby growing inside me &amp; that made me feel like a terrible person. Because I was so suicidal, I was being a horrible girlfriend. I just hated myself and wanted to be alone all of the time. 
In February I decided I needed to get help and try to fix whatever is “broken” with me. I started therapy &amp; my therapist and I both agreed it was probably a good idea for me to move back with my dad for a while (I had been living with my boyfriend, so obviously this strained our already crumbling relationship). The first little bit was fucking awful relationship wise. But otherwise I had felt like a huge weight was lifted off me. I was starting to wake up and not have the “I wish I didn’t wake up” thought every day. I started doing things I used to enjoy again. I thought, for once, that maybe things COULD get better. 
My boyfriend and I decided to work on things, so we’re still together but currently live an hour apart. He’s military &amp; is currently on course, although he’s not gone anywhere. Just super busy. Idk if it’s just because I’m pregnant and my emotions are so all over the place but I really just feel more alone than ever. I feel like I’m really wanting this is work and and trying SO HARD to make it known that I’m putting in the effort and trying to change and work on my flaws &amp; getting nothing in return.... I know that he is busy with work right now and can’t always talk but we barely say more to each other throughout the week than just small talk &amp; pleasantries and “I love you”....  I constantly feel like I’m being annoying if I msg cause I always feel like he doesn’t want to talk. If I’m upset about something, he gets annoyed and it turns into an argument and the past is held against me. 
It sucks because I’m really trying to make it work and not hold the past against him &amp; I don’t get the same in return. 
I have been off work since January because of my pelvis, so on the weeks I don’t have my 5 year old (I do one week on and one off with his father) I feel like I’m driving myself insane and the depression is coming back. He’s never there to talk &amp; I don’t have a lot of friends to talk to about this stuff so I just sleep a lot :( (my “best friend” and I are actually no longer friends bc of a situation with my bf that happened in feb) I can feel myself going back down the depression hole and idk what to do. 
I don’t feel like I can talk to him about things anymore &amp; I don’t want to annoy the one friend I do talk to everyday with the same shit all the time. Therapy helps &amp; I feel good for a day or two after but I keep ending up back here.

Like you want to be a failure.” I ignored it and went straight to bed. 
For context, my entire family is very successful and they all went to university and such. I have dyslexia so I struggle with a lot of classes. On top of that I’ve been bullied all my life which has given me a lack of motivation and will.

just need a place where i can rant and talk since you all are open arms.
don't remember a time where i wasn't depressed but that's not the post for today. was always doing poor in school/college after i lost genuine care and interest for it but things were finally looking better this semester. i got my grades better, talked to my advisor, got back in my classes, everything was good. i even got a girlfriend who i've been with since October who i recently realized i truly love, who influenced me to be better. life was honestly better than bad, and that was felt good.
but now coming back from spring break (where i worked everyday) my school is going online because of the corona virus. it's even effecting my job since i banquet and a lot of people are cancelling events, meaning less hours and less pay. but besides that like i  said i'm not the best student, but a large part of me being better this semester was the fact that i was on campus and saw everyone doing the same and working hard. even comparing myself to them, it just made me want to be productive and not sit around depressed or distracting myself. now most of the students went home (as in where they truly live) and there's no reason to be on campus. i used to be on campus all day from 9 to 10pm because i didn't want to come home, now there's no excuse and i'm stuck where depression is over my shoulder with roommates i want nothing with. i know i don't have the motivation to do it because i never have, and am literally afraid of checking emails. my girlfriend also left today so we kinda broke up which is nice. not because of anything bad, like i said things were great with us, but the distance issue is real and i gotta see how she feels on long-distance, even though i'm not  for it. guessing we're in the middle stages rn but i already cried so what's the point. if school didn't end she could've gotten a summer job and stayed with me, but now she leaves (near) two months early (which means two months longer) and idk what's our relationship now.
that's on top of the already constant stress, anxiety, depression from other issues and i tell em all ""i'm okay""

test_pid_2024,"i think broken people are wiser. : first off, let me just say i am not glorifying depression in any way. it is a serious mental illness that so many people face. i wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy as it is one of the toughest battles i've ever had to face in my life. 
that being said, it just occurred to me as i was walking in the rain, coffee in hand and passing people with their groups of friends (i know, sounds so 2013 tumblr). they were laughing about something and i just couldn't get how someone could always be happy. this group that i saw was always happy like always (we live on the same floor). 
that was when i remembered the term ignorance is bliss, and the meaning that has on our life. and for the record i'm not saying that happy people live in delusional little worlds and are ignorant in a dumb or arrogant sense. they're not. everyone has been through hardships and insecurities. 
but i think the wiser are the people who have gone through stuff in their life and ~~have the ability~~ are doomed to feel the highest sense of emotion in the worst possible way. they are able to think deeper and see bigger pictures. and that means that majority of the wiser are filled with broken people. 
i don't think i'm smart or a genius in any way (seriously my grades definitely back me up there), but i pride myself on my memory and my observance. i just kept thinking would i trade all of this thinking for a genuine smile? would i swap depression for ignorance? my answer is yes. i'd rather be blissful and happy than suffer like this. 
sorry if this makes no sense, i'm tired and downing coffee despite it only being 4:30 in the evening. but it's raining and gloomy and my mind is wandering. now that i read this it honestly doesn't make much sense to me. i guess it's a way of venting or even making myself feel the slightest bit better.

test_pid_2029,"Coronavirus is about to ruin my life. : Hey guys, so this damn Coronavirus thing is about to ruin my life. I live in fear from November to about now usually because I have severe Emetophobia (fear of throwing up) because I'm afraid of getting sick. Now I'm not afraid of getting the Coronavirus honestly, what's upsetting me is how life is coming to a stand still here now and things are getting difficult. Toilet paper, hand soap, water, and other basic supplies are getting harder and harder to find on a daily basis. I also have IBS so I go through toilet paper faster than most people do. The weather is finally getting warmer, and I was so excited to be out of the hell that is worrying all day and night, but now I have this to worry about too. Every day I come on here and see how more people are being infected and dying and it's upsetting. I feel like this is the end of the world as we know it and there's nothing anyone can do about it. It's just another shitty unstoppable force that is out to ruin everything for everyone. My grandpa is at great risk with this as he's been in a coma pretty much for over a year now due to a burst aneurysm, so seeing articles on here on the front page of ""Someone you know will most likely die from this"" is not helping at all. I know were all in the same boat with this virus as everything is shutting down everywhere, but I'm pissed off. There was so much I was looking forward to this spring and summer that just got ruined entirely.",1

test_pid_2031,"Complainer? [rant and questions] : I was called a complainer by a very close friend and damn, it hurts. Don't think it's fair. The criticism went around the fact that me complaining too much just makes the problems worse. It sounds as if I'd get better from depression if I suffered in silence.
That's definitely not the case. I totally get not wanting to be around me because I only have negative things to say, or not wanting to talk about certain topics. But that's upon you, you should just say ""I don't like listening to you complain"", not making it a personal fault of mine. I feel momentarily better for getting things off my chest and I have a friend or two who I can count on for that. Not speaking or not having someone to talk to makes me feel more lonely.
He's buddhist, his rationale went like this: *complaining is bad on the long term. Not complaining gives your better relief on the long term because complaining is fighting against the world while you should be making peace with it. When you do make peace, you can apply the energy you spend on fighting on looking for solutions. When you make peace with it, you don't have to complain about it, which makes a virtuous cycle.*
That rings true to some extent, although the rest of what he told me just sounds very dismissive of my problems. I was saying how this buddhist monk said that, when we're tired, we should make peace with it and do nothing so we can reenergize ourselves, but I never manage to reenergize myself. He said that I'm always complaining instead of reenergizing myself and I said that I can't just do nothing until I'm well rested [I have a job and a side job, I'm not keeping up but have to pay the bills]. He answered: ""complaining complaining complaining lol"".
People most of the time don't understand that when you're depressed, you have an invisible problem always with you. You can get into an argument with someone and then forget about it, but you can't forget you're tired and sad all the fucking time. It doesn't go away, that's why the complaints are repetitive. Nobody asks a person in pain to stop wailing and concentrate on getting better.
This friend in particular was never much interested in asking about my day or my problems, now I know I annoy him and I'll continue our unbalanced friendship without ever talking about or hinting at what's going in my life again - let's just concentrate on yours, darling. Now I have one more thing to police myself about.
**So, are you a complainer? Have you been justly or unjustly called that? How do you deal with negativity, having a bad life and having a lot to complain about and having friends at the same time?**
**What you think about how complaining affects your mental health?**
I just don't talk much about my life with people I'm not close to, or else it might get sad and awkward really fast. I mostly don't tell much of what is going on to friends except if they ask, and even then mostly in abridged version. There are a select few to whom I tell everything. Since I restricted my social circle a lot and keep it to myself, I don't have to deal much with controlling negativity around people. When I do make friends, I focus the talking on them and try to be as nice and useful as I can without asking for emotional support or sharing much about me.",1

And the thing is, i don't even feel that bad sometimes, i'm just really mad with everyone and everything including myself. I can get out of bed, but i can't connect with others, and i have this really strong feeling that i should really kill myself or find a way to start from scratch.

test_pid_2040,"On being okay with not being okay and going through it alone : I think this is an important step to take when trying to heal from depression. Accepting your reality and your emotions and not needing to hold on to every little thing that might make your day the tiniest bit more bearable or positive. It's okay if your friend's too busy to talk, it's okay if you run out of your drug of choice. It's okay that the only dim flicker of light in the darkness, the only thing that made you crack a smile, isn't there anymore. Don't feel bad for going through it alone. This is sometimes necessary. 
All I hear all over social media is that you're not alone, you're loved, you're wanted. What if this is not the case? Don't feel sorry for yourself if this is not the case. You need to be okay with not being okay by yourself. Because every day you go through it alone, you're giving yourself the chance to be your own support system. Forgive yourself. As long as you're alive, you objectively have a chance to heal. Take that chance. Sure, reach out for help but also, attempt to help yourself when others can't be there. You don't know if you can do it alone. You might not be able to. But you're the only one that has full responsibility over that.  EVERYONE is living their own life, worrying primarily about themselves and the ones that don't, are sacrificing themselves to do that. Which is okay for parents but not always otherwise and shouldn't be encouraged. You need a degree of selfishness to maintain your mental health. 
I hope this doesn't come across as encouraging people not to get help. I just have to point out that not everyone has the means to reach out to people and to be loved by others. No one should derive their self-worth from that. YOU have to love yourself and that takes a shit load of suffering to do correctly. But in the end, it's always worth it. Because the freedom you feel from truly loving yourself and not needing someone to love you or give you attention, is incomparable to anything else. It's NEVER too late to achieve that.",1

test_pid_2048,"My note : Saw someone post their note here, wanted to put my thoughts down in a place where no one i know can find them. 
Ive always felt some kind of guilt when i said i was depressed, because i guess i didnt really have it that bad in life. I hear about all of these poor teenagers that were born into abusive families and such, and ive always just felt like i was being an overdramatic ass or something for how ive been feeling for the past few years, i havent really gone through that much obvious hardship i guess.
Im 16 years old and ive never dreamt of anything. Ive never had real ambitions or thought about what my future could hold. I keep getting told that im a bright kid and i have a great future ahead of me but in the back of my head i knew i was gonna end up doing what im doing now. When i was 12-13, i started feeling suicidal. Bit by bit i fell deeper into the pit, feeling more hopeless with each passing year. I'd make new friends and feel like i was feeling better, then in a matter of weeks id ruin it and push them away. It's gotten to a point where i feel like im a burden no matter where i go or who I'm with. I have very few friends left, and it doesnt feel like they actually care about me, feels more like they pity me.
Idk how to explain it but i dont actually want to die. Theres actually a part of me that wants to cling to whatever i have left, and start trying at life again. Im scared of dying, but i just want to give up. Ive given up on school almost completely, ive given up on trying to be sociable, ive given up on trying to find reasons to live for. i feel selfish doing this, but i dont see the point in trying anymore. 
I dont see a point in pathetically clinging to life at this point i guess. I wanna take the easy way out, feels like im meant to do this.
No one really suspects im suicidal or depressed, ive kept it as private as i could for as long as i could. Ive always thought about whether or not people would genuinely care if i went away. I know i would get a few tears and whimpers, but in a couple years time id just be a story anyway. Doesnt seem like theres much sense in sticking around just to feel numb every day.

test_pid_2050,"Managed to overcome a decade of clinical depression, annd now it's back. : I am in desperate need of help/advice. I am female. I was severely depressed for 10 years, and managed to overcome it during the past four years. It's now coming back with a vengeance. 
Background:
My dad is and has always been verbally and physically abusive. My mom lives with him and enables his behavior because she has no choice, he is the one who makes money. He has never had any close friends since I've been alive. If someone ever came to the house when I was growing up, he would run and hide to avoid. He still does this, even if it's the pizza delivery guy coming to the door. At work, he is very quiet and everyone there thinks he is just mild-mannered polite guy. As soon as he gets home, he is a different person. Because of this, I have NO witnesses that could see his behavior. I've always suspected he has something like Borderline Personality Disorder. My family would never admit to something like this as they live in denial about everything.
Currently:
Last week, I was in a pinch and had to borrow a couple hundred dollars. This is NOT something that happens regularly, or ever at all. It made me sick to ask and I felt terrible, but let me be clear he has PLENTY of money and this is not hurting him by any means. Asking made me humiliated and he made sure to let me know how bad I should feel. Since I haven't been able to pay it back yet, he called me yesterday screaming and throwing a fit and sent me a bunch of horrible messages about how awful I am. This is nothing new as he has always been known to have complete freak outs over little issues and blow everything out of proportion.
I have some serious bills piling up and cannot make the payments plus the rent I need for this month. I am working full-time but everything is just too much. I am overwhelmed and can't imagine feeling more sad. I desperately want to take out a loan but I haven't established my credit for long enough. The only thing I can do is go stay with them.
I am so scared of having to go stay with him and have my dog and myself get abused. The last time we visited, my puppy gets very excited to see people, and he had a meltdown from the dog resting his chin next to him on the couch. He started hitting my freaking puppy over it!! Over just wanting attention/to be petted. It was horrifying. It's so hard to explain his personality because everything is like, ""How could you do that?"" He has serious rage issues that he's never been able to control and he flips out over tiny things. Then afterwards, he would act like nothing happened. It's coming down to my only option of having to stay with him and I've been up for days crying about it. For anyone who's lived with mental/physical abusers, you know that just being around these people deteriorates your mental health and causes permanent damage.
If I didn't have my dog, I would seriously be considering suicide. After a lifetime of dealing with this, I can barely take it anymore. If anyone has any advice for alternative resources, I would appreciate it more than you could ever know.",1

In Australia, on average we lose 8 lives every day to suicide and unfortunately for us males, we are three times more likely to end our lives. Everyone of these tragic losses are preventable. All too often, some MEN find it easier to criticize each other or themselves instead of building each other up, with all the negativity going around, lets do something positive!!
Upload 1 picture of yourself
Then tag 10 or more men to do the same. Build yourself up instead of tearing yourself down COPY AND PASTE
If I tagged you, don't disappoint me, you better do it!!! Let's spread some positivity!

test_pid_2066,"What should the effect be of very little sleep on depression? : Normally I go to bed around 11 p.m and wake up at 6:40 a.m every day still feeling exhausted, which I guess is expected. 
Last night I fell asleep at 2:30 a.m, woke up at 6:30 a.m. I have had more energy today than I have had anyday the last like 2 weeks though. Normally by this time of the day (like 6 p.m) i'm completely exhausted to the point that being awake is almost unbearable, but right now I feel totally fine?

Hey all, for everyone who's struggling - there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Many people have lifted lifelong, chronic depression through changing their diet and lifestyle. I know it might seem unreachable right this second, but consider that cutting out things like sugar and carbs might go a long way towards helping you get back on your feet.",1
test_pid_2069,Scars : So recently I was in school and I got kind of stressed and anxious and I was scratching my arm. Thing is I didn’t realize I had opened my skin a little till it was too late. So it now is kind of scarring and also since I pick at scabs it looks worse. So recently I’ve been wearing my sweatshirt to make sure my mom doesn’t see because I’ve already caused enough stress and sadness for her with my past history of self harm. So I’m just hiding it for as long as I can like always cause I don’t want to be a burden.,1
test_pid_2070,"My mom is an incedibly great person but I cant come over some things she did and I am having a mental break down rn : I will never be able to think about london without crying. It was a present for my 18th birthday to go there. My mom saved money for years (casually and slow but it was still a lot of time). About a week or so before we were supposed to leave I started having a bad episode again. A really bad one. As close as we got to depature day it got worse since I paniced that I would be this depressive the whole time we are in london. I really tried but it really just got worse. I wasnt really down to anything but my mom made this whole efford. She booked some kind of harry potter tour even if she knew she doesnt have the endurance and the bones to walk that fast for so long through the streets. I felt the tense in the air. There was one thing I WAS exited about and it was a musical. I am a sucker for musicals but I am also very bad at letting emotions out especially around my mom. So on the way there she was all like ""ARENT YOU EXITED?! THIS WILL BE GREAT. YADA YADA YADA."" And I smiled and nodded but it didnt felt right and was weird. But we got there. I was like a stone in london. I was unable to truly laugh even if I wanted to. Even while the play. Then after it I couldnt really let it sit. Normally even in movies I would wait for the credits since by then everyone is gone and you can just kind of sit there and let everything settle. I wasnt able to do that and then it was quiet again on the ride home even if my mom put a lot of work into keeping the mood up. I appreciate that but like I said. It was a really bad episode and I couldnt really cope with my feeling so I rather did nothing. On another day we were in some train going somewhere and then my mom snapped. ""What is wrong?!"" I didnt wanted to talk but I also hated to lie so out of my mouth came this tiny little brush of like ""Its okay."" But of course my mom was on it now. Thats just understandable. ""No its not. You are acting weird this whole time. Whats going on?! Dont you want to be here."" At this point I felt incredibly guilty because I knew what mom did to make all this happen and I just wasnt really there. I then had to cry. I said nothing since I actually didnt wanted to be there but at the same time I wanted. I just didnt wanted to be there at this moment. ""You know I did all this for you and I put work in it and you dont like it. Just at least say it! Do you want to go home?!"" I cried so badly at this moment. I felt so bad. I liked everything she had done. It was amazing. Its just my brain that kept me from Idk. Everything. We then booked some earlier flights home. I payed the half. My mom told everyone we went home earlier since my grandma was in hospital. To this day I will be forever sorry that it seemed like I wouldnt appreciate what my mom did but there is just this tiny little bug in the back of my head that is questioning my moms thinking. Your daughter having a mental break down out of nothing? Why wouldnt she want to be in her dream city? She is like... saying absolutely nothing all those days. Wouldnt you get suspicious as a parent? I hate when people blame other people for not noticing their depression as if they could change something. But just a little bit more asking? Idk. There were other stories that make especially this weird but this post is already too long and I cannot see through my tears. I really cant think about it without crying.",1

I was so bad at math that I got demotivated as hell in school so once I started university (it’s relatively cheap here, fortunately), I knew right away I wouldn’t finish it. I then joined the Army. After a mere few weeks, my back decided to give in, I was sent to the military hospital for some checks and there it was: medical discharge (they automatically give you one if you injure yourself seriously whilst still in basic training). I’ve struggled with mental health since I was about 14, but ever since I dropped out of uni and subsequently had to leave the military, I’ve been feeling like extreme utter dogshit. I’m in that “I wanna be dead but I’m too scared of dying” kinda place. I’m sure most of you know exactly what that feels like. After my back recovered I started powerlifting, I fell in love with the sport. Turns out it’s finally something I have decent talent in. It’s the one thing that keeps me alive. I’m still looking for a new job, so my days basically completely revolve around the sport. Now that goddamned virus has closed every gym. My country’s in near-full lockdown and I’ve got fuck all to do. I’m losing my gains, everything I’ve worked for. I’ve been grinding 6 days a week for months to get at the level I’m at and the goal was to qualify for the European Championship next year. Odds of that happening are slim to none with the gym being closed until at least the end of April. It might sound like a first world problem, but it’s honestly the one thing that gets me out of bed. I love the iron, I love the people there.. now I’m completely stuck in my own house. It’s a prison, both the house and my own brain. I can escape neither of them. I don’t know what to do. I truly can’t survive until May without the iron or the few people that care about me/I care about. It feels like yesterday everything was relatively fine and today, the world’s just turned into a post-apocalyptic place.

So I exerted myself socially and emotionally.. and when I came home she continued to force me out of my room, mind I’ve been dealing with wanting space to breathe all day and not getting any, so I broke down and locked my door and took a razor to my thighs....

Everything was absolutely fine till they split up and I only have one parents support now, mom's. 
However she's been taking care of my brother and all his needs as he was going into university, he always got everything he needed and a lot of things paid. He has everything handed to him. And I'm not angry at him at all for it. I'm just jealous because I get the opposite of this. 
I put myself into a big debt after I had surgery on transport to regular doctor visits and new dressings every week that I had to pay myself. My dad left me with a small debt too. 
I'm having to pay off a big debt myself because my parents couldn't help me themselves. I have to apply for student accommodation soon but I have no money for my deposit, and if I ask my mom to save up for it to help me at least to pay half of it till I get student loan she gets angry with me and starts an argument. But when my brother needs money she's right there for him just because he doesn't live with us anymore. It's saddening. Because I don't think I'll get the same parent support that my brother did when he was my age , I'm 19 and he's 21.... and he still gets more attention. I don't know is this a first born thing or what.. and our dad was present when he was going to uni too so.. I'm also going through a job recruitment process at a hospital job.. which is great because then I can pay everything off and be independent! But that doesn't make me less upset, it's about the support of your family that's important, and I know that after I start earning money my mom will be very friendly or start demanding some of it. 
I just want my parents to support me like they did to my brother. I don't care that I'm 20 this year I'll always want my parents support. No one should be ashamed of that. 
But it's just saddening. I thought that this time of my life would be so much more simple. Other people I know have it easier where their families take care of everything.
I don't know I feel so so stressed about this and I thought that I would be more prepared. 
I am not at all mentally prepared. I know what I want to study and the rest of it and I want to go to university this year but I just feel totally unprepared mentally and emotionally from the lack off support. 
I am glad that at least I have my brother who I turn to now and then for a bit of support about all this and I can see he's trying to be helpful, and I can already tell he will support his future kids as much and as long as he can, I just wish that was me, but my parents are too busy with their lives that aren't even that busy.

Started to believe that I dont deserve anything in general so I shut myself away and I've wallowed in my own thoughts .. until couple weeks ago when I tryed reaching out to my freinds for support to help me be happy with myself and that I deserve to be out and about to be more actively happy and I just felt shoved off by then like I was just dead weight Which felt real shitty as I feel like at times I've been there for them when they believed no one was and how they felt out off place

The only person I can hold a conversation with, is one friend, and he's the only one. We don't really talk, we just make a series of never ending jokes and laugh all day. That's not a conversation, it is?
The problem, and what haunts me the most, is that it's not like that all the time.
Few weeks ago I met a girl (she texted me for some reason), and we talked for like 6 hours just that day. The next day like 5 hours, and well, generally we talked a lot. I felt very good about that, because I finally felt like I was interesting to someone. A month later, we haven't had a real conversation about normal stuff in weeks. Our longest conversations now are about his parents, who apparently, are total dicks. Each time I try to talk to her like we did when we met, something happens, and our conversations like that are not interesting, I feel like I'm boring. She probably just got bored of me, I mean, pretty much everyone does. I guess I'm not interesting enough, which is sad, because the conversations we had, made me think I'm not a lost cause at all, that I can eventually talk to others, you know, hold conversations. Now I see that I don't really can, and that's making me sad, very sad. Maybe I should just give up already and stop this suffering. Is it me? I mean, is it just my brain? I'm being paranoid? How can I know? Is this temporal? If I go to therapy and take antidepressants, will I become capable of talking to others eventually? I am doomed to be this guy forever?
You know, maybe I should stop believing something's gonna change, because all my life, I've been the constant to all my problems. I'm the fucking constant, it's me, it's fucking me. I should give up. Death is better than feeling shitty all the time.

Doctors don't help me, medicine, meditation seems to not work anymore. 
Last time I had change to go big party, with some celebs in my city. Cause my work is connected to it somehow but I've never had a chance to take part. I almost NEVER drink alcohol. I remember drinking when I was younger I didn't enjoy that at all, made me feel bad. This times was different. 
I said why not then I was totally drunk before, during and after party. Plus got high on something. I had great time. I start to feeling happy for the first time in my life I was literally happy. Nothing mattered, I was in here in now.
I promise I've never experienced happiness in my life.
That was so intense that when I've back home I was crying. I was thinking about everything and nothing. About something I could change in my life.

I don't know who I am anymore. I don't wanna feel anything. Nothing that I am feeling is positive. I don't wanna be here anymore. I don't know what to do with my life. Maybe looking to the stars and waiting for death. I don't wanna pretend that I am okay, when I am not. I would give my life to my dead grandpa, he deserves it more than me.
I hate myself. I hate everything about me, my look, my voice, my thoughts... I hate that I'm pretending to be someone else, even when I don't have a clue who I am. It kills me to pretend to be heterosexual, when I'm not. I hate that I'm doing it for my family, for my mom, because they didn't accept that I'm bisexual. I hate that I still care about them even they hurt me. I hate that I didn't tell this to my dad (parents are divorced)... but his reaction would be worse than moms. I hate myself for all of these things and more.
I really hate myself for not knowing what to do. I wanna die. Death would be the best option for me.",1
test_pid_2109,"School shut-down : I dont think people realize how important it is for my school to not be shut down from the Corona virus. Going to school Is my only social interaction with people anymore whether they hate me or not. Staying home for 2 weeks sounds awesome to a normal person but that's hell for me. I hate my sister and my mother whom I live with and tolerate my stepdad. I'm either always yelling, getting yelled at, crying, or stuffing my sorrow with food; and school is my freedom from that even though I do the same things? I guess at home it's worse and at school I'm able to talk back and defend myself from people's shit while at home I have to take it or ill get kicked out. Some poeple might also think how i shouldnt be bored or I'm ungrateful for all my technology, but the truth is I didnt want any of it but ik grateful for it. I go home and I lay in bed rather then my PC, xbox, or oculus because ik just so bored of life itself. If my school gets shut down or cancelled whatever the fuck then my depression will skyrocket, will to live plummet, and over all be a billion times more bored then I already am.",1
test_pid_2110,"I'm really starting to snowball fail. : My mother is sick, shes mentally went, crazy, abusive, and can barely put on her shirt let alone help me with school and college. She used to be quick, sharp and cunning but dementia has really taken a toll on her.
My father is bullshit, an asshole, and fake as fuck. He ruined my mother, he was the love of her life and she was broken down when he turned out to be a liar. He's still leaching off her house and money, won't help me at all, etc. 
Both of my parents argued by entire life, I always believed I was the thing that made them stop kissing, having sex, showing affection. I've never seen them hug or kiss. Never hold hands. I haven't even been out to eat with them. They only argued and complained about the news.
They both sheltered me, never let me leave the house. They still won't let me learn how to drive, get a job or leave the house. and since I'm only 17, I cant combat anything legally. I have no money, I failed my high school years 
I was generally stressed going to my previous school but managing to get Bs, C's and D's with the occasional A in honors courses. Until a teacher fucked up my math grade and made me so stressed out I started pulling my hair. So I left that school and went to a regular hs in the middle of the 3rd quarter (big mistake). The teacher got fired 2 weeks after I left. 
Then someone crashed into my mother's mid-life crisis car and she stopped driving, she lost her mind. Blah blah blah 
present day. 
I'm doing online school because I thought to go to hs and dealing with fake people all day was the problem. That drains me but now I sleep all day, wake up, read a book, listen to music in the dark, play my crossword and then go back to sleep. Been doing that for 2 and a half months and I still feel the same. 
I'm smart I swear lmao, my IQ used to be 164 when I was happy as a child now it's 145 ish. 
I just don't know what to do with myself. I'm in limbo and I can't leave.
I was thinking about getting my GED but IDK how I'll get a scholarship or any aid with a 2.7w GPA (2.2uw) and a 910 psat.

test_pid_2111,"""social distancing"" is probably going to make a lot of people's depression worse : I've already had a few events cancel. The awful irony is that I'm currently in a pretty bad place mentally these past weeks, definitely a low point after a while. And my social life sucks, me trying to address it with what little energy I have, meanwhile current epidemic conditions are making that harder
I cut back on working from home too because I think that contributes to my isolation and my depression
So, yay?
It sucks knowing how literally all I have to do to see my goals through is do the work. Instead? I get tired and don't, barely keeping up on things, which contributes to me feeling behind and like my goals are eternally far away. All of these factors adding up isn't great

test_pid_2112,"Am I overreacting or did my therapy intaker cross lines? : I finally decided to try therapy again and the way this clinic worked was they have me do an intake interview with someone then assign me a social worker. So I did the intake a month ago and I'm very happy with the social worker I was assigned. However, I'm still thinking about the things that were said to me during the intake during which I felt very judged. I don't know if I'm just overreacting.  
Some examples, I mentioned that I dropped out of high school when I was 18 and he said to me in a very judging tone: ""you dropped out during SENIOR YEAR???""  
I explained that junior year was about to end for me when i turned 18 except I was failing every class because I had been skipping school basically everyday, which means I probably have to repeat junior year, which means 2 more years of high school so dropping out and getting a GED seemed like a better choice at the moment.  
Then he asked me if I'm going to college/working, I said I was recently out of work and I applied to CC which starts in the fall, so nothing at the moment as I'm living with my parents and he said: ""and your parents are okay with you not doing anything??"" 
I mean I don't really know how to answer that other than ""yeah.""
Later on he asked me if I was in ""regular education"" in high school.  I was confused so I asked him what he meant. He asked if I was in regular education or special education. I feel like at that point he was just doing it on purpose to mock me. 
Overall the session made me feel like shit and still keeps me up at night. However, I know sometimes I overreact to things and I want to know your perspective on this.",1

test_pid_2119,"Recently had a major fight with my mom, don't know how I'll manage [Pretty long] : I'm so fucking useless and wished I was dead right now
With all the coronavirus stories, my university decided to close down most of it's services and just do remote teaching for all of my classes. Today, my mom and I got into a huge fight over financial issues with me, and I just got so upset that I wanted to stay on campus at the university I live at. This was just one of a series of things that decided to force me to stay on campus and fill out the paperwork to do so (which I just got accepted for and will do until it all finished up, which my university says is temptingly for April 4).
I'm done, every winter/summer break I come back and it feels like I'm fucking dead inside, and I actively want to self-harm while there. The only reason I don't do it is because I know she'll call the police and get me hospitalized. She just fucking RUINS me and makes me feel incredibly numb and frustrated. I actively anticipate going back to school because then I at least know I'll be 4 hours away from her and I won't get as much of her.
I'm far from a good person myself, I'm always looking for something or someone to blame. I'm bad with money. I don't reach out and talk to people as often as I should, or want to, and then wonder why people won't do the same with me. I get angered  and offended relatively easily. I'm too dependent on other people, financially and emotionally. (Although the latter I've gotten better at than I was in the past, but I digress). So, like, I get why my mom wouldn't like me.
At the end of the day, though, she wants me back home because she's ""afraid for my health"" (which is bullshit) with all this coronavirus stuff. But I would actually rather die from this god-forsaken illness than get to hear her constantly berate me, say that I'm exactly like my abusive dad, not listen to my own concerns about how I feel about her and why she treats me the way she does, and will not listen to me about my own mental health, as well as making me feel as if I shouldn't openly express it to other people. I'm an awful person, but she is the fucking pits and I'm sick to death of people defending her as ""being of a different time"" (bullshit, I know her well enough to know that she will only ever be open and accepting to new ideas and opinions if they're in HER favor) or ""just being raised that way"" (which I can see more of, given that she wasn't born into a whole lot of wealth and wasn't really taken after by her own parents, only her grandmother who passed away when she was young). I don't give a flying fuck about her trials and tribulations at this point - she may have it bad, but she actively inflicts it onto me and my sisters with no reason or excuse. She isn't the only reason, but she still is a large part of my depression and suicidal thoughts within the past few years.
Now, I'm staying on campus for nearly a month and I don't want to deal with her. I have a job opening for me, but in order to get enrolled I need a Social Security card or a passport (both of which my mom have, and I know now she won't give it to me, so I'm fucked). In general, I'm just fucked - broke (only $5 in the bank, nowhere to go to), no job, and uncertain about everything, and I want to lay down and not breathe anymore. This, combined with everything else going on outside, is putting me into full-on doomer mode. Fuck this.",1

test_pid_2121,"I don’t expect advice, I just needed to vent and I don’t care who sees it. : I’m only 17 years old, coming up on 18, and I’ve had depression ever since I was 12. I’ve always kept it hidden and refused to show it to other people, even my family. I was scrawny, practically a walking stick back in 7th grade and I was made fun of a lot, the girl I had a crush even said “ew” to my face when she turned and saw me. This brought my self confidence down a shit ton so I started working out for 2 years. I was feeling good about myself for a good awhile but the depression never left, I kept wondering if my friends even saw me as a friend or if I was a loser but no one would say anything cause they get bad. So I resorted to playing video games, it became a hobby and then an escape. Playing video games distracted me from my outside problems. Didn’t think about life, school, nothing. I was invested in it but now my parents constantly tell me I play too much and when I get off when they tell me and start studying I get the overwhelming feeling that I’m a failure in their eyes because I sit around and play games and that distracts me from school work and I don’t get anything done. My grades suffer, my parents get mad, my depression gets worse, and I play even more. I was always told to “man up” and “don’t be a pussy” so I didn’t tell anyone and all I can do is cry at night when no one can hear me. A therapist sounds like the best option along with telling my family but I’ve gotten so accustomed to not telling anyone it hurts to even think about telling anyone.  I don’t want to go in anymore detail, this is pretty much the just of my situation. 
SHORT VERSION: I used to be a stick and was made fun of so I started working out. I felt good about myself but always question reality. I resorted to gaming as a hobby but then as an escape from my problems. My parents are fed up with me gaming so much that I see myself as a failure and cry myself to sleep here and there. My grades plummet, my depression gets worse, and my parents are more disappointed. I can’t tell people cause I’m told to “man up” so I’m just accustomed to it.",1

He made me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed of myself countless times. I kept in touch with him because I thought it was important to support your family and accept them. After our last conversation I made a decision to stop talking to my dad. He called right before my class started and screamed at me. He didn’t ask any questions about my life or college as usual. He just screamed. When I told him to call back after my class he said : “ GO FUCKING STUDY”. This finally opened my eyes. My dad neither loved me nor cared about me.

test_pid_2126,"My Mom is destroying our relationship : Some context: I am a 20-year-old male with a twin sister and a mother and father who live together at home. I’m a sophomore in college, and have recently had to come home and be reminded of the incredible toxicity my mother exhibits almost every single day. 
Here’s what she does:
1. She take on stressors which aren’t hers to bear, regardless of what the original bearers wished for or needed. 
2. She gets stressed, and because she seems to have zero capacity for emotional control, she immediately become: ill, rude, mean-spirited, spiteful, immature, aggressive, hostile, selfish, and reckless with other people’s feelings and emotions.
3. If ever challenged about this behavior, she always justifies it with, “well, I’m stressed and anxious and sorry for carrying about you” – followed by a dramatic spike in the previously mentioned shitty treatment of others, and zero self-reflection.
4. Life presents some mindless distraction, and she gets over it. That is until the next time something mildly inconvenient happens (no scratch that – something mildly inconvenient happens to someone else in the family). That person’s suffering is only exacerbated when the person suffering now not only do, they have to deal with the issue, but they also have to deal with the entirely separate issue of all that negative energy that my mom creates. She then of course inevitably becomes the center of attention in regard to that initial issue, as well. 
I should add that all those ugly reactions can also be manifested if it’s her own problems she’s dealing with. I could almost forgive that; but her usage of other people’s problems just seems manipulative and abusive. She’s pushing sixty and has been doing this my whole life.",1

test_pid_2132,"What is wrong with me? : I don't know where else to ask this. I guess I'll preface with that I've never actually been diagnosed with depression and I've never gone out of my way to seek any help. I'm also not suicidal, nor would I ever think of doing that. I just need some answers.
I live a pretty regular life. I have a decent paying job. I rent a house. I have a girlfriend. I have a car. I can afford to buy things when I want them... I just can't seem to be happy much anymore. 
I actually hate my job that I've been doing for almost 7 years now. I love the people, but I have shitty hours, and management doesn't seem to actually care for their employees. I've tried job searching but I always come up short or just dealing with what I've got now. I go to work in a bad mood, and I come home from work just wanting to do nothing. I want so bad to just do my hobby and play some video games, but I don't like doing that much anymore. I just want to do nothing. I want to go and get in shape, too, but I can't get in the right mindset.
My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years now. Things started out great, but they've gone downhill from there. We may live together, but we're polar opposites. She believes in God, I don't. I have hobbies and friends (we'll touch on the friends later), and she doesn't. We see things way differently, and she's nearly cheated on me multiple times but I've always been faithful and forgiveness always has its way. I want out, but I can't muster up the courage to get out of this. 
My friends are something else. I actually have a lot of good friends who I can rely on. I love them to death. I don't know where I'd be without them. I've also lost touch or just lost multiple great friends. I lived with my best friend for 4 years before he got engaged. I was so happy for him. I was invited to be a groomsman for his wedding and I was so happy for him and his new wife. They also kicked me out of the house on short notice. Like I had less than a week to find a new place and ended up moving back in with my parents. After the wedding, I haven't talked to him. I've tried, but he just seems to have left my life. It really sucks. I don't know what I did wrong or if I did something wrong. It hurt really bad, and still does.
Some might say I've had it rough. I've had 6 grandparents that I got really close to. 6 out of 8 are dead and one just had a stroke and that's been hard to deal with. My favorite uncle (biological mom's side) committed suicide a few years back. My biological mom did the same thing a year after. Her and I hadn't spoken since she left when I was 3 or 4. She sent me a Facebook message the week she killed herself saying I was always her favorite and that she loved me. I didn't respond. She was already gone to me... But when I found out that she had killed herself, I couldn't help but feel guilty that maybe I could've said something and maybe she'd still have a life. I might have hated her, but I didn't wish death upon her.
Now that you have a little background I guess I just want to end this saying I just want to be happy again. I want my life back. I want to do better for myself. I just don't know how. I want to escape this feeling of nothingness. I want to BE again. I want to be happy.",1

My parents, long story short, didn't do much to help when they knew I was depressed, and made me feel awful for taking medication and struggling overall. They are not a support system for me at all, and I am not close enough to any of my other family members to talk to them, which means that my primary source of help was my university's counseling center.
My uni just closed and moved to all online classes because of the Coronavirus, which means that I will now be stuck at home in another state with no access to any mental health care.

I wonder now why I didn’t do it when I was in college. Everyone makes you believe it gets better. Ten years later I still wish I would’ve ended it earlier. And now I can’t fathom the thought of my kids being without a mom. And I stop myself. How long can one person suffer. Especially when your partner that you’ve been “arranged” with just thinks I’m complaining. This isn’t for sympathy. I just have nowhere else to share this. My anxiety and depression have taken its toll. I always just wanted to be happy and find love. I found love with my children but happiness never came.

test_pid_2150,"Coronavirus sent us home, and now I’m completely lost... : I'm a freshman in college, and I'm an out of state student. My home life, while not abusive, has played a role in why I have struggled so much with depression and anxiety. My parents, long story short, didn't do much to help when they knew I was depressed, and made me feel awful for taking medication and struggling overall. They are not a support system for me at all, and I am not close enough to any of my other family members to talk to them, which means that my primary source of help was my university's counseling center.
My uni just closed and moved to all online classes because of the Coronavirus, which means that I will now be stuck at home in another state with no access to any mental health care. I am too afraid to talk to my parents about getting a therapist here in my current state. Plus my parents work and I don't have a car, meaning I couldn't get to an appointment. My friends all live in another state (i literally don't have a single friend in the state I have to be in now - my high school was not in this state) meaning that I will not see anyone for a long time - potentially until next August.
I have dealt with suicidal thoughts for nearly a year now, and recently had a minor incident of self-harm. I feel incredibly alone knowing that counseling is not an option and that I potentially won't be able to see any of the friends I have made in college for five months. After that amount of time, I don't even know if they'll want to reconnect. I just don't know what to do. I feel so completely isolated.",1

I've been dealing with depression since I've been a child, but being a golden child I've had to keep it hidden so that I look normal. Keep up a image so my siblings and cousins can be better versions of me. 
I used to write poems and short stories to deal with the thoughts and pain, but all the shit like ""What do you have to be depressed about?"", ""You live in the UK, how can you he depressed?"" Keep pushing me back down again. Like I'm not supposed to feel sad, not allowed to feel emotion because I'm in a better position than others. 
I guess I'm just trying to reach out and see how others deal with this shit world, how to deal with not loving yourself or where you are in life and the person others want you to be while still being true to yourself.

But I went camping with some friends the first weekend, and caught up on some video games for the rest of the week. But I’m still getting depressed more and more. Now, thanks to the coronavirus, my university has decided to extend spring break an extra week, and I’m worried it’s going to get even worse. I get it’s a safety issue and I’m selfish for making it about me, but damn this sucks. This part of the year / semester is always hard for me and when my depression is its worst.

This isn’t to say I blame anyone for having depression but me, I know it’s uncontrollable at this point. But when people degrade me, make fun of me, manipulate me, and use me I often know it’s happening but I internalize my thoughts and feelings. I usually forgive them because it’s always someone I want to stay close to, and I feel them drifting away.
It’s hard to not blame myself because I know I was too nice and giving. I know they can tell they mean a lot to me so they take advantage. No matter what they know about my past they use it against me every time. 
I’m trying to stop over sharing and being too kind. It is difficult since I’m used to mistreatment from my parent and caring for people who don’t care about me. Everyone makes mistakes but it doesn’t make me feel less stupid. Setting boundaries is new but I’m learning so I don’t get walked over anymore.

I work hard BECAUSE I have a strong work ethic and I want to learn as much as possible. I'm just fucking pissed that people who don't deserve it get it.

test_pid_2180,"Wassup, it’s your boi...hiding in a closet for two hours. : So after a mini meltdown in the shower last night, in which I slapped myself in the face a few times, and literally clawed at my arms and back and head with my short yellow, but thankfully manicured fingernails I decided to have a walk.
My dog was just staring at me, she wants to figure me out so bad. Yesterday morning I but on some Alan Watts, walked her for like an hour, got high. We danced and played. Unfortunately I’m a 37 year old dope who had to move back with his mom cause I built no career skill that is highly sought after, and Las Vegas is a shit place to find work unless you love sales, cleaning others wastes, or had a recent lobotomy.
Do lobotomies make life simpler for the person or is the poor bastard too scrambled to care I wonder?
I wonder if lobotomies are still legal? Hmm.
So I dry up, grab my thickest coat, my dirtiest shoes and head out into the neon concrete desert that is Fremont Street aka “Old Las Vegas”. The original major strip of this carnival of adult amusements and hollow tourist distractions.
I’m being overly negative without a hint of irony or humor, I’ll explain Fremont for those who only visited once while drunkenly living what I’m sure you thought was gonna be a vacation similar of excitement and absurdity of say the film “The Hangover” or have delusions but haven’t visited yet.
Fremont Street is a strip mall that should of been flattened and turned into a park. At least all the homeless would have nicer conditions to sleep on at night. You can buy benzos off some kid in the middle of the street for less than it costs to park, the security and even the cops are out of shape with visible neck tats and look like they can’t be bothered to run to their car let alone handle a crazy person if shit went down.
Thankfully Nevada isn’t very violent. These thugs out here are made of paper and I’m not even an intimidating dude.Im like 123 lbs soaking wet with a neutron Star in my pocket, but my joy and wonder has been warped into reclusivity and bottled anger. So most people I’ve noticed recently just avoid eye contact now.
Nice in the moment, but like I said I ain’t no tough guy. I just give them the stink eye so no one talks to me.
Anyway enough of that shit, lets get to the dumb things and why I’m in my closet like a prisoner put in solitary.
For one, always wear an extra layer or two before walking in the cold. Did I forget to mention my license got suspended last month? I’m gonna clear it up next month and be back on the road, but yeah I decided to walk from my apartment to Fremont. 
The walk was an hour and twenty....going one way, in 40 degree weather. I’m a fucking dummy. Can’t stay inside though. Despite the fact that my whole day yesterday was just applying to jobs, mom came in and she needs help. So as long as I don’t have full time work to help out, my brain is constantly chattering...
It’s not good enough.
Other men take care of their mothers around the age of 30. Are you a man?
She’s being nice, but we both know you are a cancer to her life at this point.
I’m a burden.
..,yeah strolling aimlessly at 11pm alone is the smart thing to do right?! Let’s go! Fremont was D-E-D. DEAD. So much for the city that never sleeps. I stopped by one of the two bars I’ve found in this state that agrees with me, Atomic Liquor. No one but two bartenders, a couple and the doorman were in attendance. Their was a motel across the street that caught my ear however.
A gate locked monthly budget stay motel/apartments. I can’t recall the name of the place but it’s not important. Gaudy parking lot with what looks like a very well crafted twisting statue of a RV trailer standing up crooked yet steady in the middle of it, behind the locked gate like a silent guardian summoned by rednecks and PBR sacrifices.
The lot was lit up, but not one building had lights on. In fact the whole lot was empty. No cars, no ground security, and no people living in it. Last year this place was standing tall, with regular guests actual people staying in it. Some weekends people would have mini-block parties and performers in this place when the gates were open.
Now, it’s a creepy neon ghost town, that plays Sinatra to no one nonstop. I tried to make a video on it but I’m staying incognito here for now. In fact this is a growing concern in my neighborhood. As I was wandering, trying to get lost in the city. Going up Fremont their are several empty lots and locked up motels and single economy lodgings that are just empty, yet on that same corner I see dopesick and desperate people living in tents and wrapped up on the concrete sleeping.
All the money this city makes in tourism, alcohol sales, restuarants, CASINOS, yet I’ve never seen more homeless and people with little to no employment like Las Vegas. I’m went past three blocks of potential halfway houses and possible lodging for these people so they can at least start trying to get off their feet. Nope, their is a nasty ass Siegel Suites where hookers go to die every two blocks here that charges 200 a week though.
The really disturbing and fucked thing to me. Some of these abandoned buildings had paintings of fake doors and windows on them. I tripped out, they were colorful and well done. Lots of yellows and stark reds swathes the outside walls. Hell the painted windows even had sketches of people hanging out of them like friendly neighbors. But the doors weren’t real, the windows weren’t real. The lots were cracked, the weeds in the concrete reclaiming it’s territory from lack of maintenance. The gates high and solid, maintained in better shape than the buildings it was protecting.
With that rolling around in my skull I was in no good shape to be alone (I wasn’t actually alright that night to begin with) and eventually made the hour and a half trek back home. Right before I eventually went to sleep, which didn’t happen until 3:30 am for those curious (I think Ive only managed about 4 hours of sleep in 48 hours, I was up at 7 am today for no fucking reason). Read another post I wrote on here, just to see if anyone gave a shit which some of you actually read, one guy even commented on it.
As goofy as it sounds I was dreading seeing any responses to it. I’ll probably avoid reading this post for a while too. Way way too raw and sensitive, but I really want to improve my writing and my social skills are basically being rebuilt on Reddit so I welcome criticism.
Even a “your writing is pompous shit you pervert” is a load healthier than what my demons keep whispering in my ear recently.

test_pid_2181,"I’m having a really hard time enjoying anything I do. : I’ve been dealing with pretty severe anxiety for several years now, it’s better but by no means “cured.” I suspect I have depression as well but I’ve never been diagnosed.
For months I’ve really struggled to find anything I’m passionate about, even when I do things that used to be my favorite things. I’m currently in college which contributes to a lot of my anxiety - thankfully I’m about to graduate though.
I have an internship, play club baseball (my favorite sport), see a psychiatrist weekly, and often play video games or watch TV shows. I don’t drink or smoke, and I spend a good amount of time socializing with friends (I don’t like socializing though and never really have, but that’s a different story).
Basically, my internship is in my dream job field and I’m sick of it already. I’ve played baseball my whole life, and often can’t be bothered to go to practice. I’m taking classes on interesting topics, and often forget to do or ignore my assignments until after midnight the night before they’re due. Video games only frustrate or bore me after a short time, and I don’t care at all about any TV shows I watch.
I feel like I’m very busy, doing a lot of things that should make me happy, but nothing is. What do you do when you feel like this, and how can I make my passions something I actually enjoy again?",2

test_pid_2188,"I (22F) am in a downward spiral and it never stops : This is my first ever post on reddit so I’m sorry if it violates any rules or anything! This is super long so there will be TLDR at the end...
The world is ending and that is the only way to describe how I feel. The world is ending and I’m suffocating but it’s not to anybody else. 
Background: I’ve had depression/anxiety for as long as I can remember. I have a wildly complicated/horrible relationship with my mother (a single mother who raised me, an only child, by herself) and a friendly relationship with my father who wasn’t around much until I was like 10 so it’s like not at all a parental kind of relationship. 
I’m in my last semester of college and it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I’m overloaded with 21 hours of classes and working 8 hours 2 days a week. 
I don’t have any friends. I used to but as I get older the depression gets worse. My self esteem is wrecked. I have incredible social anxiety that’s also gotten worse as I get older. The actual only human contact I have is my wonderful boyfriend (21M) who lives with me. He is patient and supportive in every way possible and showed me what love truly is. His family are amazing people and I love them too. They are everything I wanted in my family as a kid. 
I regularly see a therapist and a psychologist and am on medication. Two things have triggered my downward spiral: the loss of a written prescription of my antidepressants which has caused me to be off them for about a month (but I have since found and been back on them but only for about 5 days and this is also 100% my fault and I’m kicking myself for this) and the severing of my relationship with my mother. She had me young (21) and we have had a super insane relationship with no boundaries at all whatsoever. She is my absolute best friend in the whole world but also the cause of my depression and anxiety, regularly verbally and emotionally manipulating and abusing me since I hit puberty. 
BECAUSE OF ALL OF THIS I am incredibly depressed and anxious and it’s getting worse with each passing day. Something new happens with my mother almost every day where she has been cold to me. But on top of this, I have been physically sick with the flu (which is going around in my area) &amp; it has caused me to miss my class last week. It is 3 days a week for 4 hours. But I am able to work at home because we use our laptops to run the program we work on, so I have been keeping up with schoolwork. 
Last Friday was our midway presentation on our final projects (I graduate this May) and I ended up having a full on panic attack because I didn’t have enough money to print my presentation out on my university account and I left my wallet at home because my boyfriend drove me to school. It was already past time the class had started so I ran outside to try to calm down but everything had built up and I couldn’t stop crying. Needless to say I didn’t go to class. I emailed my professor an embarrassingly cringey email about what happened and he hasn’t responded. (Attendance is important in this class)
This past weekend was Mardi Gras which I did NOT participate in because it turns out I have a sinus infection right after getting the flu. I have a dr note for this. 
I relapsed on my antibiotics and had to go back today to get a stronger prescription. Mardi Gras classes resumed today at 12:30. My class starts at 1:30. I got a drs note because I obviously still feel bad (coughing up mucus, sneezing constantly, blowing my gross snotty nose every 5 seconds, deep mucusy cough every 10 seconds. It’s NOT pretty) and the class is freaking 4 hours long and I don’t want to subject anyone else to that either??? The classroom is tiny. 
So I sent him it. I said I can present when I come back this Friday. He has yet to respond to that too. 
I’m terrified I’m going to fail and not graduate. I have to graduate because I have an amazing job lined up for me afterwards.
TLDR: it feels like bad thing after bad thing keeps happening to me and I really want to just give up but i have so much pressure to not give up that it makes me so fucking anxious!!!
My anxiety is CRIPPLING me right now. I don’t really know why I posted this and I’m not really expecting any responses. But if you had any kind words to say that would be really appreciated...",2

As a senior in high school I’m expected to go to college next year, work towards a job, be an actual member of society, as we all are. I hate everything about college, but it’s either I blow my parents money for four years or get a full time job this June.

 * I noticed recently it wearing on her more than usual so I attempted to engage her in conversation to figure out what we  can do or I can do better going forward. She turned on me and let me know that in her head it's my fault she has quote ""a retarded kid she has to take care of forever"". this sent me reeling and after a few back and forth I disengaged because nothing was going to help at the moment . 
 * our son got lead poisoning at the home we used to live at and we couldn't figured out at first why he wasnt progressing and was withdrawing from us, we took him to his dr and when he found nothing I believed him,  because Im not a doctor. this was my cardinal sin in in her mind, she switched offices and new doctor suggested a lead test that came back dangerously high. while evaluating the lead damage he was diagnosed as ASD, (Autism Spectrum Disorder) which shares some symptoms with lead poisoning and many belive can contribute to autism.
 * there is no medical proof of this and ASD is caused by genetics, behaviors attributed to ASD (hand to mouth, sensory issues) are thought to be the reason there is a higher than average occurrence of lead among ASD children. 
 * upon diagnoses our landlord of 6 years illegally evicted us, but was successful due to his lawyer, the move, which nearly had us homeless and the recent diagnoses nearly ended us but we fought through it
 * our son is a smart and happy 5yo with communication issues who has improved leaps and bounds  since then but can still be a handful at times, but I believe he will be fairly high functioning by the time he is an adult 
 * my wife is borderline verbally abusive to me and sometimes our family and has a terrible temper but I thought we were in this together and its devastating to hear her say these things, I can deal with alot but it's one of those occasions where I can never unhear those words and now I will carry them forever
 * I know that what I describe is unhealthy and have known for awhile that maybe it wasn't gonna be forever but I just cant let my family come apart, I thought we were in the trenches together but apparently not, she has always acted as if she deserves this life she pictures in her head without any work at it and I have enabled her by trying g to give it to her
 * neither of us really have any support system around here so a split would basically mean she leaves and has nowhere to really go nearby and I would likely have to quit my job and start over a few hours north near my family 
 * I know therapy may help but it's not realistic and she wouldn't go even if it was possible

I have yet to formulate words. I have been so inspired to write lately and it seems my hands cannot keep up with my pen. But here I am, wordless. 
This isn’t going to be pretty. This isn’t going to be edited. This isn’t going to be long. 
I haven’t felt depressed in years. I mean, seriously. Years. I have been sad. I have been through some really rough shit that nobody should have to go through. Hell, even my body is degenerating. But I haven’t been depressed. I have handled break ups before. I have handled not being sure of my future. But right now...it seems so much harder. 
I am going through the motions. I feel like a zombie sometimes. My partner, who I am severely in love with, is for the first time, not depressed. And now for the first time in what seems like forever, I am. And I know it will pass. That partner and I, the one that I am in love with, are transitioning out of a our partnership. My heart is breaking. I don’t want to feel anymore. I know this is what has to happen. And I know it is going to hurt like hell. And I know I will survive it. But right now, I am unemployed after being fired for being sick. My dog is attached to my partner. One day in the general future, my  partner, who shares a bed with me, will sleep in the next room over. And he will date and explore and experience so much and I am so happy for him and I promise I know none of this makes sense because there is no context and I don’t need advice or anything because nobody can understand. But I am depressed. For the first time. And I don’t know how to tell anyone but my psychiatrist. I have slight bipolar 2. I was on lithium for a while and transitioned off of it three years ago. I asked him to go back on it so I will start that tomorrow. 
I say that I don’t know how to tell someone. I do. I just say it. I have a support system. I just don’t want him to know. I don’t want him to feel guilty. I don’t want to burden him. I want him to be happy. And he is. I don’t want to ruin that.

test_pid_2211,"I'm fine, until I exercise. : Very frustrated. 
Trying to lose weight but after I exercise I get crazy idontwanttomove depressed.
I'll pick a day where I feel fine, hopes are up, mood is up. I'll go for a walk (about 1 to 1 1/2 mile round trip.). By the time I get back from that walk, I'm destroyed emotionally and physically. Weight lifting takes about 15min for me to break down and hate everything, even though I enjoy the act of going someplace and doing something. Any promises I have made, any plans for day, any real rational thought is thrown from the window. I end up laying down and not moving, sometimes to great consequences because nothing matters anymore. 
Exercise is supposed to help depression, and I feel fine UNTIL I exercise. Add some endorphins to my system and I just can't handle it. I'll make shit choices until the depression goes away. The next day I can still feel it like a hangover. 
If I ""power through it"" and ignore the screaming signals to stop, the problem becomes life-halting after about two weeks. Ive never made it past the two week mark, as dieing looks great in comparison. 
What dumbfounds me is how fast and quick I can go from ""Awwwww yeh, lift that weight."" to ""fuck this, fuck you, let's die."" 
I've tried watching my diet, suger spikes or lack of suger or some weird theory somebody had regarding diet. Healthy diets and McDonald's diets had no sway. Eatting/drinking while/before/after no change in result. I don't drink alcohol so that's never really in the math.
Tried exercising less but man this is bullshit. I should be able to go for a run and not want to die emotionally. Physically your supposed to feel like shit, I think, but emotionally you shouldn't feel this destroyed from a half hour of lifting weights.

For context, this is my fourth year in university and I still have one more to go. This sounds like I'm on the home stretch, but I really don't feel like it. While my depression has somewhat eased up over the past few months, it's been at the expense of any study motivation I have.
       While I've never had much willpower when it comes to education, and have somewhat coasted through so far, this past year has been the worst. I'm at a top uni where falling behind is unacceptable. But that's not really the problem.
     I DESPISE studying. I hate it with a passion, and I can't do even the simplest of tasks anymore. I feel nothing but frustration when I think about my degree subject; any interest I had is long gone and has been for years. Essentially, I'm done with this stage of my life and want to move on to working, doing what I love, as I know this is what will ultimately make me happy; a routine, structure, the chance to have some impact on real life, and meet new people.
     The trouble is I've still got a year to go of this degree. I'm not dropping out now since I've invested so much time, struggle and money into the past four years. It's been gruelling but the end is in sight, and yet I feel ZERO motivation to get there. Which means I'm stuck in a constantly anxious rut, feeling trapped, and can't focus on anything I want to do because it doesn't have my full attention. I'm basically just in limbo right now.

Like my stomach just feels low and it feels like that feeling you get when you're in a bad mood and your heart just drops to your stomach. This has been going on for a few days now and usually when I get those blue moods it goes away soon enough, mostly after the same day when I go to sleep and wake up, but this time it's different and this isn't the first time it happened. I've felt this sadness before too, for a few days and it scared me bc usually my low moods last only for a day and it isn't emptiness. Last time it went away tho, and I think this time it's not going away maybe bc I'm overthinking it? But then again if I'm overthinking, idk how to stop overthinking and that makes me more upset.

If you really think about it we are not weak, we are super strong. We're strong because even though many of us can't do some of the most basic things like get out of bed everyday, or brush our teeth, we still keep on going. We struggle, we suffer, and as much as we want to stop we don't. 
Some of us have our reasons to keep our feelings to ourselves even though we are about to burst. Some of us tell as many people as will listen. I think both take enormous strength. No matter who you are or what you're going through, you are doing your best and I'm proud of you ❤",2

test_pid_2237,"My will to live is gone. : I was always that one kid who was the world’s biggest dick hole to my classmates who were just trying to have fun with me and make good friends. I had no friends to hang with during recess and nobody ever showed up to my birthday parties throughout my whole life. When I got into high school, it was my lifelong dream to stop being lonely and extremely sad and make a few good friends to hang out with, but instead I got made fun of having no friends and being “the weird quiet kid” that I have been for the past 12 years of my long and pathetic life. I did eventually end up making good friends outside of school. We would always go do something fun like go to the park or go boating and then play video games together. Now we see each other extremely rarely because they are “busy”, probably hanging out with better friends than me or making out with girls. Here I sit in bed crying myself to sleep as a sophomore in high school, almost losing all of the few friends I have in my life. My pathetic life is quickly withering away from the constant battles with myself and high school society. All I want is a few good friends to laugh with and maybe a girlfriend too, but I feel so sad and tired all the time with constant thoughts of suicide. Last week, I stopped hanging out with my very school friends during lunch which caused me to just completely let go of the hope of a decent life like everybody else at school was privileged to get.

In fact, it's not only me suffering but also my family, except my father who is a dictatorship toxic guy.  
I was depressed since I was 12. Since that day, I kind of only had hatred inside of me, but these past years I learned a lot from people I never knew how nice they were. Heck, I even cried when I met such people. I also learned that by accepting our fates, hardships don't cause the same effect when we think everything is going to be fine all the time. I keep reminding myself that happiness and love comes from the heart of sadness and anguish. Just like how medicines are made out of poison. I keep reminding myself that I'm not the only one suffering, forced to wake up every day and avoid people only not to feel awkward when talking.

So, buckle up, here we go!
I'm currently a 31 old white man from the Middle-Eastern part of Europe. I'm living in a small backwater settlement with not much more than 4000 inhabitants; a kinda old-school place, where the middle-aged and older know each other pretty well, but the younger act like they were from the big cities.
I never really felt like fitting in, but for majority of my lifetime I didn't paid attention to it, as it never really bothered me until recently.
Apart from a few occasional trips I never left my hometown. I was raised here. My family lived in a house with a nice big garden. Five of us. My maternal grandparents, my father, my mother and I, the only child. After being at age I was sent to preschool, but my parents took me out after less then a year, because I was always getting sick (minor colds, nothing serious, for somehow I always ended up beind sat right next to the window), and i was kept at home 'till elementary school. In school I was concidered a good (even exemplary, as they claimed) student and child. During my school years I always had exactly two close friends, everybody else was just an acquaintance, even in my own class. Until fourth or fifth grade there wasn't really any ""problems"" with me socially, but as puberty started to kick in amoung us, I slowly started to became the odd one. I always had long hair, and that alone was enough for the others to pick on me. Mix it with me being the ""nerd"" who always got good grades, was taken to competitions after competitions in natural science and literature subjects, hated popular music, listened to rock/metal, never went to parties or clubbing, didn't smoke, didn't got drunk with the others, never liked dancing or any sports. Also as puberty progressed started to I started to gain some weight. Nothing to sugarcoat (because I would eat that too) I was quite chubby. Not obese, but I had my handles.
After finishing the elementary school, I attented to the local high school, (which is located literally next door to my elementary), with 85% of my old class, so we basically brought the social structures with us. Before that, we got distant and separated with one of my close friend up to the point that we didn't even spoke to each other for 16 years now. He got buddies with the rich kid of the class, they went to a different school, started clubbing, getting girlfriends, so he lived his normal life, in which there is no place for a nerd like me.
During the 4 years of high school my non-existent social circle shrunk even more. I replaced my old friend with a new one, so there was three of us again, but apart from occasionally hanging out with them I started to keeping to myself more and more. The others were busy dating and partying, while my attention turned towards reading, paying attention to anything that was in english and playing computer games. I was still in the top of my class when it came to the grades, but I had to put literally zero effort in it. I've just read the given texts of the lessons once or twice, (even though I'm a very slow reader), said a few sentences when I was asked and it was enough for acing the four years. You can imagine what it did to my attention span, and willingness to put effort into anything.
During the twelve years I tried to court two girls, but was rejected by both of them. When I told my mother about my first attempt at asking a girl out (one of my classmate in sixth grade) her reaction was very disapproving, along the lines of ""You shouldn""t do that!"" which I think also added an extra weight to my baggage. After that, for a very long time I didn't even try to do any advance on any woman.
I finished high school with an A+ degree in all subject (they even had mercy on me in sports). I took a succesful language exam in english far more earlier then the rest of the class, without attending to the extra and summer lessons.
Of course, as ""bright child"" (buy only in a local sense as it turned out) I attended to a university right away. But... I didn't really gave it a thought. My family was not too wealthy, and I didn't wanted to overwhelm them financially. I was always said that I think maturely, more mature than my age, so that also reinforced my decision of attending to the nearest, cheapest possible university, from where I can get home in an hour so my parents don't have to pay for dorm and such. I literally just take the option of least resistance instead of taking a look into what I'm good at or what interests me. Now looking back this is one decision I regret.
Making friends was never my strong suit, and it didn't change during the university. But some of the teachers instantly liked me. I also gain entry to an ornithology group and was listed in the crew of the next offical, certified experiment run by my professor in my very first year.
Then life decided to take a turn towards the more darker areas. After being done with my first year, during summer break, my mother get ill, almost died and spent 52 days in hospital, mostly in intensive care. I went to visit her every single day. Then it turned out that the complications and treatments given to her in attempt to save her life ruined her kidneys. From that moment we started a 6 years long struggle with all the few ups and the many downs. With dialysis, my mother temporarly got better for a while, but after a some time she just gave up on life, refused to attend to dialysis and in the end, let herself pass in excrutiating pain. We tried everything from being kind to being authoritive but nothing worked. The last line I heard from her was ""Go away! Go home! Leave me alone!"" as a reaction to my desperate attempt to get her to change her mind.
The next day she passed away when I was on my way to the hospital.
During this period my grandfather was also getting more and more sick, with more and more severe complications from diabetes and aging. Under half a year I lost both my mother and my grandfather.
My grandmother was and is totally devastated by the events, yet, God bless her, she is still kicking and active, but the age and sorrow is slowly gaining on her. She often claimes that I'm the only reason she's still alive. My father become more closed and keeping to himself, however, lately he tries to be more open.
On my life the toll was huge as well. I dropped out of the university and stayed at home to help if needed. But in the peaceful days when everything was calm, and my help wasn't needed I started to seperate myself from the world more and more. With no friends, no money and no opportunities to blow off some steam, my only entertainment and escape were the books, movies and pirated video games.
Later when money was thight I started to work at the local school as an administrator. I kept working there past the death of my mother and grandfather. Though it was offically a standard 9-5 job, my boss had her own civil organisation too, with which I was ""supposed"" to help, so I worked overtime and often during the night too. That once more locked me up in my office and my hometown for good. Apart from the occasional movie nights at the theatre in the nearest city I never really had a night off. The paycheck was enough to cover the bills and a few insurance but not much more. Travelling wasn't an option, because I didn't have money, and I didn't (and still do not) have a driver's licence. The overwork and working behind the desk took its toll on my physique too: I'm tall-ish, 185 cm, but also 130 kg, and I'm out of breath very easily if I have to maintan constant physical effort. The only thing I can do in a prolonged fashion is walking at a 2-3 km/h speed for hours, but I breaking out in sweat very, and I mean very easily (in the first 3 minutes), and my body is covered with soft fat tissue with no hardness of any muscle. These things hintered my confidence when it came down to approaching women as well. I tried to hit it off with two of my colleagues after a 15 years pause, but, again both of them rejected me. So I never really tried any harder than that after the repeated failures.
I even gave up on making friends.The few people I know and hang out with are from my workplace. And even towards them I am more and more suspicious, especially since I (think) I learned to read body language and notice all the small details of aversion on them. As far as I can tell my relationship with them is contrversial at best, because if I organise something, they agree to tag along, but I rarely got invited by them.
The one thing that didn't change is that once again, I consider exactly two of them my close friend. A handsome young male dance teacher and a beatuiful young musician woman. We often hang out at my place, which I rent out to dance teacher (for dirt cheap, as I live in our family house with my grandmother and father) talking, getting drunk, playing some games and stuff. Sometimes they say that they like me, and they never ask me to leave, even if I tell them that they are free to do so, because I know that I'm difficult person to bear. But I just can't shake the thought of they being on ""good terms"" with me because that's how they ""repay"" me for I rent the place to the man for cheap and because I actively seek to help woman emotionally, beacuse she is a fragile soul (there was a few occasions when I spent a good portion of the night with her either in person or on the phone because she ""needed someone to talk"" to and reached out for me). This woman is also very attractive and kind, as they say a ""dame to kill for"", but I'm pretty sure I'm not her type and suspect that she and the dance teacher are attracted to each other, and are sleeping together, so no room for me in her life. They say that there is nothing between them apart from our friendship, but I know that to man made several attempts at seducing her, and as far as I can tell after half a bottle of hard liquor they playing the flirting game quite good. And that's just the things I see when I'm with them. That's why I constatly hint them that they can tell me to get lost if the had enough of my company).
Apart from the above as today, I still don't have a university degree, no driver's licence, and I recently left my job as well, becauce there was a change in the person of the director, and the new boss couldn't really support neither herself nor me against the attacks from a few co-workers and the members of the directional group originating nothing more but personal disdain. Luckily I had a few month worth of expanses saved up in cash, but now my money run out and I live off a loan and the rent the teacher pays me.
I'm not without a job entirely, though, as a ""leading"" agent of an insurance company, who made a life insurance for my grandmother, took an interest in me (I was present, actively interfering with the processs when they signed the papers in order to keep my grandmother from accepting a disadvantegous offer), and she introduced me into a program for new agents with education, professional support and such. Because of this, I started to take driving lessons too, but I struggle with it. I also feel unsure about this job opportunity as an insurance agent, as it is a quite controversial trade; but everybody, who has authority in the program, even the regional director wants me to stay, even though I tried my best to scare them off.
So for now I still stick to it, because I think this is my only option to earn some good money as I have literally no other paper about any other, noteable qualification. The only ""certification"" I'm somewhat proud of is my offical MENSA membership (but I'm suspicious about that too, since I only passed for the second time I took the test; when they wanted to open a new local group in the county I live, so I wager they lent me a few extra points, so I pass 130 mark in order to gain more local members.)
I couldn't stand to leave the country, because of my grandmother, who is still deathly afraid of me gettig hurt or in trouble if I don't spend the night at home.
So here I am, jobless, moneyless, without a car, out of oppotunities. A kissless virgin, who doesn't even bother to approach woman anymore, because I can tell at least a dozen reasons right from the top of my head why they should reject me and go for someone better (what measn literally any other man than me).
But the hardest part of all: I literally have absolute zero motivation or interest towards anything. I can't tell why I keep waking up in the morning and do the tasks I'm trusted with. I think it's not even depression as for most of the time I feel and think about absolutely nothing, it's just static in my brain. Other times I just feel anything apart from rage, despair, incompetence, overwhelming impotence and being sick with everything. I don't even feel the need to change or improve my life anymore because as I see it, it would be so much effort for literally nothing. I feel the discomfort of not having this or that but only when I witness others living their life. And sometime I can logically prove myself that I would need this and that if I try. But that's it. All are fleeting all so quickly.
Yeah, I could earn more money, but for why? My standards are pretty low: a place to sleep with a computer and internet acces, some food, and a bathroom.
Getting an SO? Why? And how? I mean I would like to have a family and children, of course, but first I would need to induce emotions other than disgust or disdain in a woman and keep her attention for more then two minutes. But I'm so incompatible with people that it does not go for me just like that, naturally. It would take an enourmous amount of effort and even if I would somehow accidentally succeed, there's still a high chance that she would just leave me after I realize that I'm the most boring person in the world. My life is so bleak and blank that when I'm with my ""friends"" I keep making up stories about the adventures and exes I had when I was younger in order to I have something to talk about. And even though I try keep these stories consistent, I feel they see right through it but feel so sorry about me that they just let me keep talking.
Honestly, all I want to do is run away. I'm tired of my life, I'm tired of myself. I'm uninterested in everything. I just do things so people leave me alone about it. Because I still hear from the few of them saying ""why don't you do something with that big brain of yours?"" ""Why don't you get a nice lady for yourself?""
BECAUSE I CAN'T, THAT'S WHY!
Because there is no place for me in this entire goddamned world. Because all I get is disdain. Which is replaced by hatred if I warn others about something and it turns out that I was right. Like I'm not even allowed to be correct about anything. ""Smile more!"" ""Be kinder"" ""Ask about and talk with people"" they say! Of course, &gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt; should go out of my way just to get a whole lot of ignorance in return.
They just keep talking, but don't know, they just don't understand! The suggest me to make friends... in a settlement where I'm the wierdo, who was accused with basically everything from being a homosexual through being a pedofil to being a drug addict?! Are they even aware what they are talking about?
I'm also tired of that few people giving me more credit than I worth. Because I literally worth nothing. That's literally my life: I'm either prasied for something I'm not or I'm the last, forgotten piece of shit.
In my younger age I was actively advocate against suicide. Now I wouldn't mind if somehow all of this just would end.
I want people to let me go. I don't want to die explicitly. I just want a place where noone knows me. Were noone expects or want anything from me. A place where I can finally make peace with the piece of deadweight I am on this world and live the rest of my miserable life in seclusion, being THAT wierdo from the third floor, who you just see the corner of you eye in the morning and in the evening.
I just want the world the stop remind me about what they think I should be. I know I had dreams, I know I had potential. I could have been an astronomer, a doctor, an actor, an electrician, or just a simple family man. But that's the point. I COULD have been. But it's over. It's in the past. I can't be any of those things anymore.
I just want people to finally agree with me that I played all my cards wrong, succesfully wasted my life, never lived up to my potential, scream and yell at me for being an utter piece of shit, then throw me away and let me wither in peace. I simply ask the world to leave me alone without giving me signs of ""Hey! Why don't you do this or that?""
Is that so much to ask?",2

People acted like I was such a terrible friend because I was going through a rough time. (Not saying I was the best of friends, but I still made regular contact at first) When I finally felt better they were no longer there. I get it that isolation doesn’t help me but when that’s the only thing that feels okay and they just let it happen, then I’m consumed. It’s not like people would ask me to hang out and I’d decline, I never got asked. “They’re too much of a downer.” Geee thanks, that’s really gonna help my confidence that my friends aren’t just gonna leave me once I’m not useful to them every day...

T try again.” I haven’t even been on one day since my ex, let alone any sort of physical contact. 
To make things worse, I lost my job due to sickness last summer. So I’ve been unemployed since then with barely little income. Plus, I live in a tiny town of about 500 people and the very few friends I do have are all in relationships.

I’m praying for you all and wishing for the best outcome for those who suffer from the grips of depression. What helped me was looking at where I was and who I became. I hated looking at myself in the mirror but I took that and lit a fire in my soul because I did not ask to be here like everyone else but I’m here and I’m not going to keep letting life kick me in the ass!

Next time you wake up in the morning make yourself smile look in the mirror and say I’m fucking ready for this shit and get yourself out there!!

So my day starts with me waking up early for school (i need to because i take the big yellow bus). i don’t really get enough sleep maybe  6 hours. i usually am pretty tired. when i get to school i always talk to my friends before class starts and talking to them always makes me smile and laugh when we have a fun conversation. i always fall asleep in the first block on A and B days. i’m always bored in class. whenever i have a class with a friend i always talk to them and it lightens my mood. after class i take the yellow bus again and i get home. when i get home, i feel somewhat empty and i don’t feel happy about anything. i live in my moms friend’s house with my parents in one room. their house has a roach problem but i guess it’s livable. i’m always on my pc playing video games and watching youtube. whenever i try to play an online game i can’t because the all the bandwidth is being used up because there are literally ten people who live here total. i always get mad and then sad playing so i watch youtube but only for a while then get bored and don’t know what to do.

Last night I was in an accident and my honest to god first thought was “should I just end it?” : Last night I was involved in an auto accident on my way home from work. It was not my fault, but my vehicle is most likely totaled and I will probably still owe money on it after everything is payed out. I do not have a car. I do not have a credit card so it will be hard to rent one, and I am 23 so I will have to pay extra fees on top of that. I only had this car for 3 months.
Last month I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. It has so far been an easy transition into my new lifestyle but I fear for the medical bills starting to pile up.
I am currently $80k in debt with student loans. 
When I graduated college no one would even give me an interview. I accepted my first job offer but work in a miserable job field with an overbearing boss. I work as a driver manager and manage a fleet of trucks but we have been severely lacking freight options these past couple months which has led to me not meeting my revenue expectations, leading to my boss being on my case every second of every day. Due to my illnesses I have had to miss numerous days of work and now I fear (without a car) I will not be able to make it to work and, along with me not meeting expectations, will lead to me being fired. 
Which if I am fired, I will further be in debt seeing as just two weeks ago I signed a lease for a new apartment and am locked in until next February.
I don’t know what to do. I am 100 miles from my family (had to relocate for my job) and  am in an increasingly unstable financial situation. I am lonely, my only social interactions are at work or on Xbox live. I am too poor to go out and all my friends live back home. I feel isolated",2

Since the first two are in my only friend group, everyone who could help me is out. The last one has only me as a support system so I can't leave them. I ended up cutting to deal with it and my mother found out. I convinced her it was a one time thing and I was fine, but she will check my arms and legs and I need to spend more time with them. I know they want to help but this is more punishment than anything. Self harm is one of the only effective coping mechanisms I have. My mental state is worse just being around them. At least I don't need to do therapy again, I hated therapy. I also hated that my parents made me do the most ineffective coping mechanisms for me constantly.

test_pid_2302,"Actions are self-destructive though consciously I am not. : Hey All, 
I rarely post on reddit, but reading so many different stories here and a situation that happened today made me want to reach out and get your opinions. 
**Me:** I recently was told by my therapist that I have depression.  I mean I went to her because I thought (+was told) that I have depression by the people around me, but it helped hearing it from someone official.  Currently, I would say I've been doing better compared to a few months ago with a combination of understanding my heightened anxious feelings, medicine, and gym. 
**The Situation:**  My boss called me to his office and pointed out something that was due from me for a while.  We talked some and the summary basically being ""help me, help you"".   He paused for a while to figure out the right word he wanted to use and said, ""Yes. Self-destructive. That's what you are self-destructive"".  He said, ""I don't know what happened to you when you were a kid but stop thinking you'll be unsuccessful and that you don't deserve it"".  He gave examples, ""...not completing hours on time was asking to be fired, missing meetings, coming in late. These are all self-destructive acts."" He is all in all supportive. He said him and the team likes me and that occasionally I'll produce good work which is why haven't been fired.  I realised that I've been self-destructive not only at work but also at home.   
**Question:** If anyone, even in an intimate setting (Eg. home with gf / therapist), asks me do you want to get fired, or do you want to not graduate.  I could not logically conceive, even as the best devil's advocate, any reason to be self-destructive.  But then my actions say otherwise.  I feel that unconsciously I feel that I am worthless, though in a conversation that idea won't even come to my head. This **really bothers me** because I can self-reflect fairly well.  But I wouldn't be able to begin describe why in the moment I chose to do those things that I know will end up hurting me.  
I feel that this may be a common enough trait, that I don't think I'm alone here.  But I would love to read other people's views on my or their situations for this.  
P.S. -  I really resonated with this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9esueu/anyone_else_feel_worthless_after_making_a_simple/e5rc5x6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), which then inspired me to reach out here. 
TL;DR:  Don't think I'm worthless.  Cannot imagine a reason why I would think I am worthless, but a lot of my actions are self-destructive and highly point towards that I, unconsciously think I am worthless.  And sadly, my actions do speak louder than my intent (words).",2

Nor is being ugly. Being beautiful and ugly can go hand in hand. Being in love falls in the same place. Love is rage. Rage can be love. Love is life. And you can experience all these things at same time. It's confusing. It's mind draining. It's beautiful and full of hate all at once, when your heart is broken. Being ugly does not deal with your appearance. It's all about who you are. We are all ugly. We are all beautiful. We are all disappointing. We all are wonderful. But what you do with it matters. I personally can't help but be ugly. I cannot stop it. But neither can the person I want to be beautiful the most. The person you want to help the most is the most horrible person. That's why you love them. That's why you want to help them and to fix them. They can't be fixed. Could you though? They don't accept help, but you can. This is for my daughter. Someone I most desperately want to save from an ugly, beautiful person. My heart is torn and my mind is being ruined. I find myself slip away until I see them both. I only then, remember love. I remember a love I will always have. A love I shouldn't have, but still do. Wanting to protect them is natural. Wanting to protect yourself is natural. The problem? You can only pick one. After picking one, you still don't win. You live with it. No matter how painful this is, you cannot give up. Do not give anyone that power. Nobody deserves power over you. But you should never place your heart and give away someone else's at the same time. Pick your real love. Pick yourself. Pick your child. Your family. But never place your feelings into something else just because you feel over and out. Put your heart where it belongs and figure yourself out. First and foremost, love yourself, love your family.

test_pid_2312,"I push away the people I get close to : About a year ago, my whole world was flipped upside. My passion, my love, my friends were all taken from me, I found out march of 2019 that i had almost completely torn my rotator cuff. This forced me to quit swimming. Keep in mind for the past 4-5 this had been my life, my coping mechanism and even where i made my friends. Having practice every morning and evening. Now i go to school everyday and come home to sit in my empty room alone with the lights off on my phone.
I began to resort to texting and meeting new people online, but eventually i started to push these people away because I’m scared of letting them know my struggles and that i don’t want to continue anymore. I’ve repeated this cycle and blocked so many of my once friends. 
My mom constantly showers me in affection, she’s always there for me, she’ll buy my favorite foods to try and cheer me up, she’s paid thousands of dollars on MRIs and medical expenses so i can pursue my dreams. Shes always wants to spend quality time with me. To be honest she’s the only reason i keep going, but I repeatedly push her away, i refuse to hang out or talk to her, she’ll insist on giving me hugs and I’ll refuse. I know I’m a horrible person for refusing all her affection(non assertive affection).  I’m desperate for affection. I’m constantly searching for it but when it appears i reject it and hide.

test_pid_2315,"Becoming Independent : Lately i've been very depressed about the idea of becoming independent and growing to be an adult. Im 17 and I'm suppose to gradate this year, but never have this feeling of anxiousness  and fear not *dwell* on me. growing up i was very sheltered and till this day i still consider myself sheltered. I've never really gone out and seen the world, I've only been informed of the dangers by my mom because luckily she got to see it herself. And while i am so pleased that i was told about those dangers unlike some people who've been sheltered, it feels as though i cannot entirely accept that fact. I'm a very sensitive person and I dont even know how to defend myself. throughout my years of schooling, I've always been bullied and too afraid to defend myself, I don't know where this trait of mine came from because I consider both of my parents to be very guarded and defensive. I hate the fact that I haven't developed that side to me. another thing about me is that I'm almost like a baby inside. Can't handle too much pressure. At home i act like a little kid but once i step foot into the outdoors, there's like this mask that comes upon me out of nowhere, and I feel as though i have to behave as this sophisticated being. idk how to act like myself in public. im always hiding my true feelings because im afraid of judgment. the person that people have perceived me to be is not at all how i perceive myself. I'm not defensive, i'm not assertive, and i don't even know who i am. I'm a sensitive child inside who on the outside is looked to be something im not. and i honestly hate it. today I asked a woman if i could borrow her phone and she gave me a rude stare, as though she was disgusted with me and my overall presence. On the outside I looked like i couldn't care less that she behaved that way towards me, but in reality i was going to cry my eyes out. little things really hurt me and it sucks that im that way. I really wish i was this bold person who could handle a kick in the ass,but I can't handle anything and it makes me worry to death about the future. I've been very depressed about the idea of being on my own and getting out into the real world, because this world is so cruel and i don't think i could possibly handle it. I feel like im too sensitive in this world and everyone runs over me. People tell me im independent. and of course that's because of my reputation of being an introvert. I like being alone but some if it has to simply do with not being judged or hurt, or not being accepted or whatever but i'll say this now. I am not independent and that's just the truth. I thought i was independent all these years but i feel as though im not. I can barley shop without freaking out because im so worried about what other people think of me. I can hardly order food alone. Talking on the phone and making important calls is an issue for me. Im so tired of people assuming im just this serious person who has their shit together because honestly that aint even me. Im just a child inside. :/// idk what this is but i guess you can call it a vent of mine. im sorry this is so unnecessarily long and all over the damn place.",2

test_pid_2318,"Getting my life back together... slowly : I'm 21. I think it's safe to say I've been through a lot, I have trauma related issues, depression, all that fun stuff. 
Anyways 
My current living situation sucks. I currently pursuing an out (a temporary group home that'll help me get back on my feet). 
It's been a hellish year. Last summer I lost one of my ccockatiels (a day before my birthday even) and I don't mean he died... I mean the person I trusted them with made the dumb decision of letting them out near an open window. I never saw him again and I moved away. He was only a baby. :( 
From there I complete shut down, he was my best friend and my other tiel's mate. 
I fell completely out of line with self care and hygiene, I was going through the motions in therapy, and my uncle was giving me Adderall everyday. I was barely eating. My diet was entirely Addy, energy drinks and the occasional hamburger. 
So that was my life for like a year. I got out every now and then but mostly I was inside playing games and abusing drugs. Not very fun... 
Then I moved out to my mom and stepdad's, didn't really want to, but I figured it might be nice to get a fresh start. It started off nice at least. 
But my step dad is an alcoholic, it's so bad that on the occasions where he makes food you can smell it in the food. I can also smell it when he's halfway across the house. He constantly calls my mom a cunt, a slut, every name in the book pretty much. 
And then there's my biggest personal insecurity... My teeth. My own complacency has cost me them and I need to have some work done eventually. 
And we'll I guess things are looking up? I have a counselor now. I have a social worker who's helping me out with services and such. 
Right now I'm just searching for something better than this, I feel like I'm growing more and more determined to not let myself become a nothing. And I always forget, I'm only 21..

It's complicated,but everyone judges and says either stick with what you have or get rid of what you have and see what happens. Basically my mind thinks while I talk. I have really high highs and very low lows. I'm stuck and my daughter is the only thing I know for certain. I see a therapist next month,but I'm optimistic and pretty sure I will just be told to stop talking to these women that I have made friends with and shared feelings with and just focus on my own self and my kid,but I don't have a life. I have zero family apart from a grandmother that helps. I just want to feel the love from a person that is attracted to my physical being as well as my insane mind.

test_pid_2331,"Depression that Manifests as Rage... How did you gain control and what helps? : Hi guys, I’ve never posted or shared anything like this before... but I believe I may suffer from bouts of depression/rage disorder that comes and goes. I’ve never been diagnosed officially as I have never really been to a mental health expert but I am having an issue with my depression manifesting as rage constantly and want to really just open up about it to see if anybody can relate. More importantly I just want some advice on how you control it and what has helped you? 
Today I had a rage attack in my car on my lunch break at work. I got triggered from a phone call from somebody (customer service associate) dealing with my car insurance and I just snapped... I just screamed and cried on the phone cursing and berating the person and hung up and then immediately called my boyfriend uncontrollably screaming and crying in my car when I finally yelled the words I just want to fucking hurt somebody. I don’t really feel the need to hurt others it is only in these rage attacks fueled by my depression that comes back to haunt me every month or so.
 My rage has caused me to black out. I have bashed my fists into the wall making my knuckles bleed. Have banged my head against the wall, clawed at my skin, ripped my hair out. I used to stab my mattress with a knife but I have tried to make progress on my own and stopped self harm actions completely... my boyfriend is very supportive and we acknowledge my issues when I start going back into depression... 
Lately I think the anger has been resurfacing because I just feel like There is no god. That I’m an animal for slaughter. I used to be “spiritual” but I just ruminate on my own death every day and think about how nothing matters. And it makes me angry. Black out angry where I become a toxic person. 
I become a verbally abusive, screaming, uncontrollable person. And it leads me to very dark places where my mind loses control. I am angry at everyone and every thing and it feels like I can’t get myself back followed by deep shame when I have an outburst.
How do I gain control? Or start to gain  more control? I want to be a calmer person. I feel as if I make progress and I won’t have a rage attack for about a month and then I give in and just lose it completely. Like something just ticks and goes off in my head and I completely just want to lose it. 
Any advice is helpful, thanks guys.",2

I really need some help processing this. : So yeah, my mom dropped this on me last night while out at dinner. I'm having a hard time processing it. I'm 25 M and due to some personal stuff from 2018, I've been living at home since. My family is small, it is just me, my mom, and my dad. I am an only child. My moms sister and parents live close by and i rarely see my dads family because they are up in New England. The thought of this complete change in the dynamic of my family is honestly scary.
Last night, with the assistance of my aunt, my mom told me that on friday, she is moving out and into a new house not too far away that she has decided to start renting. Apparently for the past 3 weeks she has been slowly moving some of her things in. She plans to do inform my dad that she is filing for divorce via a letter on the counter (this is what she was told to do by her attorney, from what i understand she wasn't even supposed to tell me). He gets home noon on saturday, and I am the one who is supposed to be picking him up. This is what is honestly destroying me the most. He has no idea what is about to hit him and i do. My mom begged me not to tell him and i still haven't. i just don't know what i'm supposed to do knowing what he has waiting for him at home. He isn't going to take it well. He is catholic and tends to hold onto some of the traditional ways. I know it is going to really hurt him and it is hard to just watch from the sidelines. I seriously do not know how to best handle this situation. I've become sort of isolated from my old friends since moving back home and i don't really have anyone to talk to anymore. I was just about to reapply for college and finish my degree but now, i have no idea what the next 6 months looks like for me.
Their marriage:
I can't really remember the last time they were happy. They don't hate each other but there is always tension. It is to the point where they both just assume the other is in a bad mood which leads to a perpetual bad mood that never gets better. My mom definitely has some issues she needs to work out as far as anxiety and all that goes. My dad seems like he's been depressed forever now and has always talked about how he'd love to transfer his job up north somewhere but never considered it because of my moms job and the fact we've kinda settled here. Overall, a very complacent relationship. My dad is pretty traditional so divorce has always seemed taboo.
My mom stayed with my aunt last night because i preferred to be by myself last night but she is coming back home tonight and we will probably talk about things. I don't know how to express that i am angry with how she handled this. I always been bad at expressing my emotions especially if it will upset someone else. I don't ever want anything to come between myself and my parents. they are the most important people in my life, they're all i've really got. What scares me is that if my mom does end up making me essentially be the one to tell him, that will cause irreparable damage.

test_pid_2352,"Spouse Struggling with Depression and Im Completely Lost : My wife has been dealing with depression and anxiety for as long as I've known her (10 years in August). Last year she started getting more help with this and seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. They started her on some medication which has helped... But she really started spiraling late last year. She went from working a full time job, progressing in her career, and being involved with our family and dogs, to drinking heavily, which led to becoming alcoholic, and now she's on FMLA to get it all under control. The alcohol part has gotten better, but between doing treatment at a facility and attending AA plus her medication, she's completely wiped of energy every day. I am trying to help and be supportive, but I'm also holding down my own work and all the financed to keep us going so I'm pretty wiped too. A lot of her identity was tied to her job, so it's really a struggle for her without it, but there's no way she could go back right now and do anything with these energy levels. FMLA will run out soon, and I doubt she'll be in any state to go back by then, but I don't know what else to do. We've talked about her just quiting, but it's a great job otherwise with great benefits and pay, and again it's really tied to her identity. I think the freedom from not working would be great until she's got a better handle on the depression and anxiety, but how of I even start to say that? I'm really worried she'd just spiral.worse without something to do or some other purpose. We've tried exercise, getting outdoors, games, crafts, and other stuff to find hobbies that might call to her, but nothing really fills that job-shaped void so far. We're only 28. We have vacations and events planned months out, but I can't see us doing any of them. We've only told her side of the family. They're supportive and try to help, but they live on the east coast and we're on the west so there's only so much they can do. No one on my side of the family or any of our friends know really. I feel guilty wanting to tell folks to explain why I'm flaking out on them or not participating, but I have this whole other thing going on in secret, and her needs come before them. I have zero experience with any of this. I keep hoping there will be some guidance counselor or advisor to come in and explain what the actual real difference is between leave vs disability, and who else we should be seeing or talking to, and what a realistic time table is for any of this, and in general how to get my wife back. Maybe she'll never be back to 100%, but I still love her, and it's tearing me apart not knowing how to help her. AA folks say the family has to be able to go on in their own life and not be dragged down by the person's addiction, but with depression and anxiety, I'm scared to death of what would happen if I'm not there supporting her every day. None of this is her fault. She's trying really hard every single day. We're both very detailed people who like to plan ahead, so the ambiguity of it all is driving us nuts. Like some days we might go to the mall, do a workout, play with the dogs, and make dinner together like nothing ever happened. Some days we may not leave the bed and just watch Gilmore Girls while eating only peta bread. There's no rhyme or reason. I'm really sorry for all of this wall of text, but I think it at least helps me to say (write) it just to vent. If you made it this far, thanks! Good luck to everyone. You matter.",2
test_pid_2353,"How do I (25/f) apologize and make it up to this guy (29/m) for treating him badly for no reason? : So I have known this guy going on two years. When we hung out we usually drove around and talked or just listened to music. We did have oral sex occasionally. 
I hadn't seen him for 9 months so like a week or two ago I texted him and asked him what he was up to. He told me he was at a hotel for work three hours away. I went up there and we ended up having sex. 
A few days ago I went to his house to hangout and I ended up falling asleep for close to 8 hours on his bed instead of hanging out with him. When I woke up he asked me if I wanted to go out for dinner and I told him I wasn't feeling well and went home. 
Last night he offered to take me out for dinner. I didn't want to go but I decided to anyway. When we got to the restaurant I told him I didn't want anything to eat and I basically just sat there and watched him eat while I drank soda and played on my phone. I don't like eating in front of people or going inside restaurants to eat which is why I didn't eat. Plus I just wasn't in the mood to hangout and wanted to go home. 
When I said bye to him I just gave him a quick hug and he leaned down to kiss me but I walked away. We usually kiss when greeting and saying goodbye to each other. I really like him a lot but I just feel like I ruined everything. We are both in our twenties. What should I do?

test_pid_2361,"Some of my perspectives on depression : I've spent a decent amount of time on here reading posts and also a good amount of my life depressed. I wanted to share some of my observations on depression that I don't hear about too often. 
""1a) Vicious cycles of depression:"" 
Many of us know depression as a cycle that feeds on itself as sustenance. If we're depressed because we're lonely that depression also makes it more likely that we avoid social interaction making us more lonely making us more depressed and so forth compounding onto itself. You may find this to be very devastating but I believe knowing depression as a cycle can be useful if the psyche is ready to step out of the cycle. Cycles are like false traps, to explain this idea I want you too understand cycles in other things in life. All life is cyclical and all cycles sustain themselves by repeating the cycle. One example is the water cycle where water evaporates by heat into the atmosphere until it cools and collects until to fall back down as rain. I suggest you think about other cycles because this may help your understanding of cycles. The interesting thing about cycles is that they cannot sustain themselves in and of themselves. All cycles have some kind of mysterious force or energy that kicks starts and then sustains them. In the case of the water cycle it is the heat generated by the sun. So there's an interesting paradox here that applies to the cycle of depression. Even though the cycle seems perpetual like a never-ending dark night or you feel trapped in the cycle of depression that seems endless there does not exist any cycle in life or of life that is able to sustain itself in and of itself. There is always something mysterious something beyond fueling it. If this source energy could be located and eliminated it would also end the cycle.  
""TL:DR"" Cycles are not internally sustainable such as the cycle of depression. If one could be successful in determining the external energy fueling the cycle the cycle can discontinue. 
If 1a didn't work then continue to 1b 
""1b) All sources to cycles are ultimately mysterious:"" 
If 1a didn't work for you you've got other problems. Sometimes we can locate the source and transcend the cycle, sometimes not. If you are reading this then you tried to locate the source of your depression. What happens is that you may find a potential source but upon further inspection of that source it itself revealed itself as another cycle a bigger cycle or a more complex cycle and now you nonetheless hopelessly find yourself back where you started or in an even bigger mess of cycles. To illustrate this picture we can talk about the water cycle. We know the water cycle is powered by the heat of the sun. The heat of the sun is due to none other than the nuclear fusion cycle. If we were to inspect more closely the nuclear fusion cycle we would also see that this cycle is also created by other cycles. So we see here that all sources to cycles are cycles so cycles are cycling themselves. This is contradicting 1a isn't it? I did say this was paradoxical. In this state advice or knowledge isn't going to help you anymore because you're actually trapped in the cycle of knowledge, if you made this your profession you'd be called an epistemological philosopher. Realize the reality of this code of language is knowledge it's the very poison that is feeding your cycle of knowledge you are trapped in. Period. What do you do? Idk God help you. 
""2) Depression as a deeply personal thing"" 
Many of us know depression is very personal but I don't mean personal as in my private parts are personal. I mean personal as in for each of us it is very much our own and no two is it the same. A burden for most of us to carry at times but deeply ours. We experience this when we try to explain our depression or seek understanding or empathy we may often find the people we explain it to don't quite understand where we are coming from or may even degrade you making you feel worse than had you just kept it to yourself. Can you remember a time perhaps before you were depressed wouldn't it have been extremely difficult to understand depression in that state? Or maybe your memory is really fucked well consider this. Imagine going to a Chinese guy and explaining simple instructions in English, he just doesn't speak your language man. Or consider birds after a major financial crash and recession every other wallstreet wolf is jumping off a building but the pigeons don't give a shit they'll happily peck away at your succulent corpse. My point is that the world isn't depressing you're depressing. You're this package of depression like a hard drive with 500 gbs worth of depression. Some may find this to be a continuous struggle but I offer the opposite perspective. Everything in your life since your birth up until this point has made you depressed in exactly the way you are depressed right now down to the most minute of details. Well, at worse a terrible life or at best a kind of sadistic trip. If you're a higher functioning depressive you may find this perspective useful, because you might be more capable of taking on your depression. Is it possible to be happily depressed? To in a way own your depression as a signature or birthmark? Like ""Bitch please even if I'm orgasming I'm still like kill me please""  because that's my truest self. 
TL:DR Depression isn't just a phase I'm going through dad, it's my lifestyle
3) What If I'm really fucking depressed and about to kill myself FOR REAL 
At lot of people in the past have done it many more will do it in the future. Bet you didn't think I'd say that. That's just the truth it seems you wanna know the truth. They say when you die you get to find out what life is all about so basically the truth right? Well maybe that's you, let's just say it is. Many people have killed themselves for all types of reasons. Some did it accidentally they just fucked up once oops and they died for it blood on their own clumsy ass hands and feet. Some because they were seriously fucked deep in enemy territory maybe tortured for weeks months starved and at the brink of death, they thought lets just get this over with. Some because they just said life's not for me or shit has changed I'm done with this crap to hell with it. Some because of anger like I'll show those asshats when they find my corpse they'll know what's up. Some in glory like those guys that went into the nuclear reactor they knew they were gonna die. They saw purpose beyond their flesh and bones a legacy beyond their conscious life. For all of us our destiny is death, and for a small minority of us it will be directly connected to our own actions. But here's a shower-though don't we all die indirectly because of our actions and isn't that indirect suicide? Sure you didn't know or sure it wasn't my fault I got cancer or it wasn't me who choose to be born and now subject to the destiny of dying but you're like that baby screaming away after it's been shot out of the cannon straight into a wall of spikes. I mean it's already too late you're donezo kid. You were finished the moment you were born and so was I. Dead but alive another paradox for you, I know someone out there likes these. But here's the thing, before you pull that trigger, really how dead seriously sure are you that your destiny lies in lead? Or in Pills or underwater or hanging from a tree? That's all on you homie. 
4) Killing yourself is like quitting. Fuck Quitters, Quitters go to hell
I'm saying this because we human's have a serious thing against quitting. And rightfully so but maybe not in the reasons you may expect. To explain I want to talk about evolution. Probably none of you are into bush-crafting but I'm sure you've all seen Bear Grylls drink his own piss, so you should know how motherf$#king hard it is to survive the old fashion way. However, we humans have done that for way way longer than we have been jerking off at our screens. At a very very deep level us humans were selected by nature to perform and survive or die. After many many generations of this we have you and me in the year 2020. So you can imagine why we hate quitting and therefore hate quitters. In the wild you could not quit, you could not take a depression day to cry and eat pizza and snuggle with your body pillow. You had to be 100% on and ready for anything. Always planing ahead, preparing for the night, preparing food, fixing tools, etc. etc. In the modern day we call this studying for exams, practicing your arts, investing for the future, work hard and working smart, \[Insert Any Tony Robbins Quote\], etc. etc. We put a ton of value on these things because we're in it and don't realize it. I don't mean to knock on it but to show that it can be seen as a game. Life as a game, as something not totally dead serious, and as with all games intended for us to have fun.

test_pid_2363,"I just cut ties with my only friend : Yeah. The title basically says it.
I'd been mulling over this for at least a few months now, ever since she told me she cheated on her boyfriend of over a year. That might seem insignificant but she was around when I was cheated on and she got to see how emotionally broken I was afterwards, even up to this day. She saw me go from a sad, but relatively 'normal' person into the paranoid, emotionally broken mess that I am nowadays.
I wish I could explain it in a way that everyone reading this would understand it but I just can't really put into short enough sentences the way it changed the course of my life and my emotional development after it happened. She saw the way that it ruined me as a person and how it ruined the way that interpersonal relationships are formed for me now. I think what I'm trying to say by pointing that out is that she saw the way it fucked up her friend, and it astonishes me that she so happily did it to her own partner.
But yeah. He never found out and with my exit from their lives I don't think he ever will. I saw too much of myself in him after I found out what she did to him that I couldn't spend the time around him without crying the same night. After I found out, it brought all the same nightmares back that had been slowly slowing down. He's in the same position I was in and he would probably react the same way too, and I just can't be the one who does that to a person. I can't be the one who turns his world from an okay one to one where everyone is lying to him.
I didn't say goodbye, I don't see too much to gain out of saying goodbye to her. I finally have my closure from the situation and I don't want to give her closure if she happens to need it.
I don't know what I seek to gain out of this post but I feel kind of lost? I've already come to terms with losing her permanently and I'm pretty happy to leave her behind now that I've had all this time to think about that and the implications behind that, but I don't know where to go from here. Do I try to make another friend and hope this new person doesn't turn out the same? Do I instead focus my time towards hobbies and building up my storenvy shop? Is it even worth it to try to make another friend right now? I don't feel too excited to try to scout out someone new.",2

test_pid_2368,"I'm having a rough night [rant] : Mainly because I can't see my boyfriend. We're currently going through a long-distance relationship and I can't see him in person until December. And it's further complicated because I can't afford to go home, and he can't come up here to see me because 1: he's busy taking care of his stepfather and 2: His parents don't know we're gay. I hate not being with him so much. We talk occasionally but it feels like he's so distant and doesn't want to be with me. I get that he's busy and way more antisocial than I am but I hate it so much. Before we started dating I used to be in a very dark place. I was closed off from the world and everyone else around me until I met him. I wouldn't talk to anyone and I had no idea why. I was just constantly depressed. I later found out that I had depression and anxiety severely, and it had been inherited from my mom (I didn't know that was a thing). It didn't help that my mom was one of the stricter kinds, and forced me to close myself off from friends for whatever reason at a very young age. She's gotten a lot more accepting since then, and I love her to pieces. I'm getting off track. Anyways, I always felt at peace when I was with my boyfriend, and I love him so much for that. He helped me out of a very dark place and I can't thank him enough. But after tonight I just miss him so much that it feels like I'm in that dark place again and I hate it. I'll occasionally feel like this but it goes away after a bit. But this time it's different. I had just gotten off the phone with him and I just felt so bad. Nothing went wrong with the conversation or anything like that. I just hadn't heard his voice in so long that I missed him so much. I hate feeling like this.

test_pid_2370,"Will it actually help? : Since around 2nd grade I haven’t the ideal happy kid. In 3rd and 4th grade I would have random crying fits that I had no reason for. In 5th grade, not a lot of people liked me, and throughout middle school I was mostly shunned for being the weird kid. The only reason why I had a friend group by that point is because my best friend since 2nd grade introduced me to his friends throughout the years. Now, I’m in 11th grade, and things have only gotten worse. The summer between 9th and 10th grade I started drinking and hit a low point in December where I attempted suicide. Afterwards, things got better for a little bit. I felt better, more confident, and even got a girlfriend. I stopped drinking for the most part and had fun for a while. Taylor cheated on me and I got back to drinking. That brings us to now. I don’t have my license and I’m 17.

test_pid_2371,"How the hell do I already feel the way I do? : It's kind of strange. Nowadays, when I look at myself, I can't see anything good about me at all. Everything people say about me just seems hollow, but I also know that my negative thoughts are mostly just anxiety speaking.
So when I empty out those anxious thoughts of how 'awful' I am, all I get is nothing. Kind of like I see a statue instead of myself. I've been hit by heartbreak, low self esteem, attempted suicide, you name it. No doubt, as I'm a teenager, all of those feelings just keep getting amplified.
But in times like this, when the storm's decided to go away for a while, I just see nothing there. Nothing of merit, but nothing to disdain. Nothing useful, but nothing detrimental. Like my worth as a human is dead-set on zero, and that I just possess no real traits, good or bad.

test_pid_2375,"Something I wrote after reflecting for a bit. : I’m learning a lot about myself all the time. This time has forced me to reflect even more again.
I am... unhappy. My life is unhappy. I’ve had dysthymia since 2015. Since I recovered from depression, I haven’t been okay or normal since.
I’ve had periods of normality, and those were bliss. But they didn’t last long. And they were only due to the fact that I took antidepressants. The real ones; and my kind - love and affection from a partner.
Those antidepressants helped me cope with all the unhappiness I had within me. They balanced everything out and made everything okay. Things were still miserable, but I had them to keep me afloat. But when they are no longer in my system, things turn back to shit because I’ve lost my only source of support and sanity.
And that’s something I’m trying to figure out how to change, or at least how to cope with. 
But it’s insanely difficult. Mindfulness takes so much effort. Trying so hard to just make yourself okay and to be normal takes so much effort. It doesn’t make sense. I can’t commit to the amount of effort, which in itself sets me up for failure already.
I’m thankful that I’ve become clearer than ever about this big part of me. But I’m still clueless as to how to go about fixing myself. I don’t have the time, nor the motivation, nor the resilience. And I can’t just psych myself up and say that I do and do it anyway. It’s going to be a tough journey of trying, failing, and trying again.

I listen to music to make myself feel better every night because Im a failure every day. I could just be using that time to make my life better but I sit around and continue to be worthless. I continually disappoint everyone.

test_pid_2380,"So, my friend left. : I'm not really looking for anything in posting this here, I guess. Just throwing my thoughts to the breeze.
There's a social forum I like to hang around on each day. I make friends there, talk about whatever our lives, about whatever's in the news, about nothing, about each other. I had a friend there who I'll call Jane, who would mostly just post lighthearted stuff, but she'd come onto anyone's post when they were hurting and offer condolences and try to make them feel better. We would have nice little chats and play around the drama on the website.
Well, last December, after I'd known her for like a year, she posted a thread that kinda indicated that she wasn't feeling well. I don't remember the details, but I sent her a message asking her how she was doing. She said she ""doesn't open up to people,"" and... I was kind of worried, so I pressed the issue. 
Apparently, Jane had been habitually bullied and bitched at by another user on the site when she was like 16 (4-ish years ago), to the point where it wrecked her mood all of the time. That user had just returned a few days ago. Due to the time lapse, basically nobody remembered her except for Jane, and both of them pretended as though nothing had happened. The former bully kinda started attention-whoring; she would post a quadrillion selfies and cute posts to get responses. Jane was bothered by the way everyone kind of just accepted the ex-bully; it hurt to see someone who'd caused her all this pain get praised to high heavens.
So I told her I'd stand by her if anything happened and otherwise comforted her to the best of my ability. And I stopped being nice to the girl she'd been talking about. Jane had asked me not to mention the old feud because that'd cause drama, which I certainly understood and rolled with.
That all was just the prelude though, to the real subject of this post. A couple of days ago, she posted something like, ""I can't do this anymore."" Like, a real SunnyD type of situation. So I sent her a message asking if she was alright.
Her responses were... a string if deeply pained emotions just oozing out of her head. She said she was leaving the site, wanted to hurt herself, kinda implied that she might kill herself. I spent a few minutes trying to get her to talk to me about what it was that was bothering her, because she didn't want to... Jane said she was going to cut herself and I made her promise to use a sterile blade and keep a phone within an arm's reach, which she did.
She explained that she was coming up on a year from her mother's death from cancer, and she'd had a really great relationship with her up until then. She asked me if she would see her mother if she died, and I told her that she wouldn't. I cried a little when I sent that because it was such a miserable truth that I needed to say. If my friend killed herself for that kind of false hope, how fucked up would that have been? I did my best to just acknowledge her suffering and encourage her to let it out. 
She deactivated and reactivated her account a few times in the span of a few minutes. I got the sense I didn't have much more time to make an impact. I told her that I hope she gets professional help, and I'll never forget what she said next.
She said she was really embarrassed. She asked me if I thought of her any differently now, and you can probably guess my answer. I cried a little more, knowing that she'd repressed her feelings so damn much out of shame.
God, why am I writing this?
And I told her that she was totally normal for feeling that way, and a psychiatrist would 100% understand in a heartbeat. I think she accepted that answer. She messaged me back a couple more times and then left for good.
I hope she's recovering. I hope I might've kinda steered her down the right path.",2
test_pid_2381,"I keep losing : I don't know how to begin this, and I used to be a great writer. I used to write so often, but slowly that was lost. I once could create songs and pick up any instrument, but the music is gone. I could cook by communicating with food on a spiritual level, and these days I have to force myself to eat. If I felt lonely I would hit up a friend to hangout. Nowadays I am too afraid to leave and lack the motivation to socialize. I used to use tinder and other apps to find sexual gratification, even had several FWB, my confidence and sexual prowess was incredible. I am currently in a relationship, and the sex was better than being single, but recently we both lost our sex drive for one another. I don't even find people attractive enough which compel me to want sex. I don't even find myself attractive. I used to take pictures of myself, model for some friends, now I can't wait to leave my sight in a mirror. My job is, on paper, the best stepping stone I could have asked for. I bartended and served while navigating post grad life after losing my career opportunities within my field at 23.

This fear has infected me, this fear of my own worth tied to my job. Logically, I can see the flaws in the fear, but...well, hate to swear, but fuck is it heavy... I am losing interest in everything else slowly. I just got out of a mental ""fog"" that lasted for an entire year where I just coasted along my existence. I am 28 years old, and I am really just in such a mental Hell. I am able for the first time in my adult life able to have professional help, but I feel it is so slow. I haven't been happy since my move to NC 2 years ago. I have a job, a lease, a partner, and other things which make an instant move impractical right now. We acknowledge this place is not good for us, but I am losing hope in the future. I can't keep losing. I don't want to go back into the fog. I am trapped in a hole of my own creation. I wish I never left Richmond. I wish I followed my gut about NC. I wish I kept my family at a distance. I feel like the Argo right now, but without repairs.",2

I am a 80's kid so for me its difficult to talk about these things with my family and friends i was taught to suck it up and take it like a man . 
As we all know the suicide rate among men are the highest perhaps because we were taught not to talk about our feelings  .  I don't know, all i know is we need some type of support structure.

I had hurt a lot of people when I tried. Somehow it always ended up like I'm playing a game with them when I approach them then run away when they approach me back. But I swear it's not intentional, I just can't help it. How can I let people see me when I know with almost certainty that they'll leave once I start being real?

test_pid_2393,"Should I reveal my insecurities to my girlfriend : Sorry in advance I’m drunk and have nowhere to turn and my thoughts make me wanna fuckin end it.
I just feel like she’s ashamed to be dating me. Like she tries her best to keep me compartmentalized from her friend group (I have met her best friend maybe 3 times in 1 year of dating). I read her journal (I’m a piece of shit I know) and in one entry she described a past event she hosted where I wasn’t originally invited, and some of her friends wanted to bring their SOs so she eventually invited me too so I “wouldn’t feel bad, I’m sorry but I don’t want him to come”. I think I’m good at communicating issues usually but I’m afraid of this one. My idea of a relationship is to be with a friend who I can introduce to my friend group and we can all be comfortable around each other, but clearly that’s not hers ( we don’t live together if that makes a difference).
And to be honest that whole thing bothers the shit out of me but what is there to even do about it. And everywhere I read on reddit other men post about their regrets about revealing their insecurities to their girlfriends, and how that makes them lose attraction or whatever. I’m sure you’ve seen what I’m talking about it’s common on askmen. 
Anyway thanks for reading if you made it this far. I really needed to just vent because i feel like shit. You don’t have to reply or give advice but I’ll appreciate any if you do.

test_pid_2394,"Anyone else hate how fast time goes by? : Day in and day out I just kinda do my functions and mope. I go to classes, study if I need to, I go to work, and I’ll even go out on weekends to parties where I’m reminded of how socially inept I am and just how much panic and anxiety that much stimulus puts in me, and my downtime is generally just laying on my bed high either napping or on this site. Its not a bad routine but its something I’ve settled into and I guess is more productive than my old high school routine of go to school, get home, grind xbox till bed, repeat. 
Now that I’m in college, its a fucking blur. 2 and a half years gone by and I’ve got nothing to show for it but mediocre grades, a failed relationship, and a set of fraternity brother’s that wouldn’t trust me with screwing in a lightbulb. I’m not dumb, but my mind is all over the place in social situations so I guess I don’t communicate my ideas well enough. 
High school was 3 years ago for me. Feels like a few months honestly. Winter break was 3 or 4 weeks ago, feels like a single week. It worries me. As discontent with life as I have been for 20 years, I still don’t want it to fly by. Sure I feel like a husk as a shamble through my routine but I feel as though this experience is better than nothing at all. I don’t want to lay on my deathbed and just think “I moped my life away” before going into that good night. 
Worse, it gets faster. Anyone older I’ve mentioned this too just laughs and says ‘wait till you graduate, then time really flies’. WHAT THE FUCK?? WHY WOULD THE HUMAN BRAIN PERCEIVE TIME LIKE THIS? I want to savor life - (the irony of course being the now and then suicidal thoughts, but I’m not gonna do it, I just have the thoughts) - not blast through it distracted, worried, and anxious all the time. 
Does anyone else worry about this as much as I do?",2
test_pid_2395,"What’s been on my mind for the past year : I never tend to tell anyone whats on my mind but I'm feeling particularly down at the moment so I thought I'd make a mini rant (is that what I should call it?)
I was diagnosed early last year with depression and of course followed suit with antidepressants and counseling, it was also around the same time that I met my now ex girlfriend whom I truly fell in love with despite the agonising travel distance I would often bare with for the short time I actually got to spend with her in person. Somehow I made it through my final year of school even though the daily challenges I would encounter like getting out of bed or attempting to take my own life. The support I had from friends and family was more then I deserved, however I was constantly worried about becoming a simple nuisance to them so I rarely told someone how I'd been feeling.
Jump to September and my girlfriends 18th. As soon I got there I could tell something was wrong, she'd been unaffectionate and even others had noticed too, I initially deduced it to her dealing with her own life stressors however I made sure to ask during some downtime at the party that night when to my surprise she told me she was gay. I really didn't take it to well, I cried on the spot however she'd wanted no one else to know yet so I had to tell everyone that I'd just had to much drink for the night and act like everything was fine. The following two days were even worse, having to put on a straight face for all her friends and family and be the good boyfriend. All that time and even now I never hated her or got mad, I was just upset, upset how I could be dropped from her life so suddenly with no explanation. I never understood how she was just suddenly gay now. She never talked to me about it or attempted to explain and I never asked because I was sure she herself was just as confused about what she was going through. A week later I was finally able to tell everyone that we'd broken up and attempted to deal with the countless ""wow you turned your girlfriend gay?"" comments. I know of course that's not how it worked but to say I wasn't embarrassed or that the comments didn't get to me was a lie.
A month later and I was finally graduating, two hours before it officially started in my full suit, I was in my English teachers office finishing off English work so that I could actually pass all the while dealing with the fact that my Nan had been died early randomly that morning. I fucking loved her, Nan was one of the three women in my life I attribute to making me the person I am today. However because of this tragic occurrence none of my family made it to my graduation, not that I'd blame them of course nor that I really deserved any recognition for the shitty excuse of a pass I was handed.
Fast forward the whole party events that most graduates attend (I didn't, I was to broke and depressed) Everyone has started to leave for further study. Most of my friends have moved on while I never made plans for anything of the sought. I feel like a deadbeat, I tried to kill myself at my friends 18th three weekends ago, I didn't deserve the help I received from the people who found me and rushed me to hospital. I can't believe how selfish I was to ruin people's night like that, I wish I'd done it in a more private location.
However what really hurt today was seeing a post on facebook about how my ex was now dating a new guy, a friend she'd hung out with quite a bit when we were dating. I still don't hate her. I'm not even jealous, I'm just sad, hurt and hating myself. I’m just left wondering why I’m so wrong, I’m sure I’ll get over this in time. Time is great for coming to terms with myself.
Finally after writing this I’m not really concerned if anyone truly reads this or not, I’d just like to know that it’s posted somewhere.
If anyone actually does read this I just want you to know that people like me really do care to hear about your own troubles, it feels truly terrible to keep it bottled up and that even telling strangers can make a difference.",2

test_pid_2397,"I am so tired of the constant disappointment : This is a throwaway account. I don't expect any response or anything. I just need a place to write down my feelings and maybe just maybe I could get a little bit of hope. I have never really told anyone the full story since, since I have some trust issues. 
As far as I could remember, I never really had a happy childhood. I basically grew up with my grandparents (mom side), while my mom was working 3 jobs to just keep us fed and sending most of the money to my dad. And my dad was never around, since he lived in a different country at the time.  I don't think I even have any memories of him until I was 9, when I finally got to lived with him. That was mostly due to the fact that my grandparents from my dad's side didn't want us immigrant there. So when my mom and I finally got the chance to move in with my dad and his parents, it finally felt like a family. But the thing is, my grandparents from my dad's side often verbally abuse my mom and I when my dad isn't around. My mom always took the abuse hoping that it would never reach to me, and while my dad had his anger problems, she always protected me from any actual danger. But I always knew, but there was nothing I can do. I felt hopeless, but I thought at least I finally have someone to call dad. I knew he loved us, especially me, but he actions were a bit violent at the same time. My mom fear the worst if she were to go to work, and my dad were to take his anger out on me, so she left me in the care of my grandparents ( dad's side). Between a broken family or an abusive one, I rather have the broken family. Because it seemed like my grandparents were so tired of us, they frame my mom for abuse. And I remember waiting for her that night. It was later than ever. I was scared, my mom was gone, and I started crying uncontrollably. I beg my dad multiple times to to call my uncle for help, and he finally gave in. My uncle hired a lawyer got establish an alibi, and my mom was freed. That was the moment, my mom knew there was no where safe for her and I. So she took me and ran in the middle of the night, using whatever little money she had to trade for a flight ticket to anywhere. And that was the last memory I had of my dad. That 6 months wasn't much, but at least he was there.    
When I arrived to the new location, my mom had very little income. She was working hard to get herself a job, and start fresh. With little to no money, there were days were all we could afford was cup of rice for the day. And the day my mom finally found a job, we celebrate with a can fish with rice. That was one of the happier meal I shared with her. She continue to work 3 jobs just to provide for us. And then she met a man. I was 12 at the time, and when he started to sexually abuse me, I did everything stay away from him. I intentionally get extra weights, try to be around my mom( when she wasn't at work) as often as I could when he was around, and when he would try to touch me while I'm asleep, I would try to block with my stuff animals. I was terrified to be at home. I couldn't tell my mom since, it seems like for once she was happy, and stable. I didn't want to ruined that for her, and so I kept everything to myself. Slowly I found myself to be more and more suicidal. But my religion told me that its a sin to kill myself, and so I kept on breathing. Numb, looking for any kind of love or attention. I was isolated without a family or anyone to trust. That lesson was reinforce when I finally made some real friends during those years, or so I though. I thought if we were close enough I could share what was going on in my life. It was just the two of us, I thought I could really call her my best friend (lets call her Jess). And then she met a new friend (lets call her Erica), and our little circle got just a little bigger. We had some really good times. They were my escape from home, but slow I felt that Jess and Erica were excluding me on their hang outs. Jess would began to tease me endlessly about my weight and Erica just join in on the ""fun"" ( when I was intentionally gaining for self protection). At one point, they would start to wearing matching clothes for parties and event. When I asked them if they had gotten me matching clothes too, and they told me off. I knew they no longer wanted me at their circle. At that point, I had completely given up on them. I'd purposely chose a different high school and maybe a new group of friends, and start fresh. 
Fast forward 10 years. I finally feel mature enough to meet with my dad. I wanted to tell him how much I have grown. And I just wanted to know how he was doing. I was planning on buying the plane ticket the weekend during my break. And the two days before that, I received a phone call. I was told that he had pass away. I had finally gotten the courage to go and see him, but I was already too late. I just wanted to tell him that, I missed him. And that I loved him. And that I was doing okay, and I do well in school, and even thought he wasn't part of most of my life, I have always remember him. I was ready. Ready to meet him. Ready to see him, to see how he was doing. And now the last memory of him was the one where he was laying in the coffin. Why is it that I try so hard to reach out, but results is always so disappointing? Again and again, I am reminded that there is no point in having hope. Why do I even bother trying anymore. I'm just so tired. I just want it to be over already. If I don't wake up tomorrow, what is there to lose anyways. At least the pain, the disappointment, the loneliness can finally stop. I am just....so tired.",2

test_pid_2401,"Trying to find answers.. please help : (16 M) i'm gonna delete this soon.. **please** give me an outside perspective on this. Mostly curious as to what this state of mind is called and just trying to understand why i enjoy it.
so lately I've been feeling apathetic, nostalgic, depressed (maybe just EXTREMELY sad), extremely mellow, and whatever else. I seem to enjoy feeling this way but can't find a reason. Im not an emotional masochist as I dont go out of my way to hurt myself at all but im just letting life happen to me. I have anxiety and depression so this is not necessarily unusual but the apathy is new. It's like im romanticizing a mundane and incredibly boring lifestyle. I'm not dissatisfied with anything and i'm actually extremely optimistic and (what i call)  a gifted ability to rationalize situations. For example: I may be extremely jealous at the fact that the girl i currently have feelings for is smiling with someone else (i know blah blah unhealthy) but I also know she is her own person and can do whatever she wants with her life and I dont take my anger out on her or anything else (which i dont even have 99% of the time), I'd say a good way to describe it is intense sonder (yes with an s). I think what I enjoy about feeling this way is the very philosophical and introspective edge I get from it. Over-analyzing every situation, asking myself how people feel, making stories for their lives, fantasizing, and gosh whatever else.  It kind of calms me when im anxious.. so when im worked up ill just say ""man no one is thinking of you at all"" or other variations. Uhh back to the girl i mentioned. I had a huge crush on her for the longest but when we finally started talking and after my anxiety is mostly gone I seem to enjoy time away from her more than being with while also getting upset when seeing she hasn't messaged me. for context we have been acquainted for about a month and she thinks that im so cool (her words i swear lol) but after talking for a week or two weeks we'll go a week or days without speaking which is always because she leaves me on seen. Also sounds like its online but its not we just dont get the chance to each other often in school due to business, conflicting schedules, and what I assume is mutual disinterest/anxiety. I make music and write and I seem to be at a creative peak (mostly inspiration from Vampire Weekend) so that's also a plus.......
Uhh im really trying to say everything here so sorry for the somewhat random jumping around.
I think about the girl a lot by the way but not just her as I am a total GUY and like multiple girls but the others Im attracted to physically. Hope I dont sound like an incel or nice guy im honestly pretty normal (said every nice guy ever (JK JK))
I dont take any medication, dont really talk to anyone about this, been this way since the start of the week or maybe two but its been building up this whole month. I hope I was clear about everything and im just wanting an outside perspective on this im not looking for ways to feel happy although technically i feel comfortable this way. BTW ive felt this alot in these passing years and theyre my favorite times to look back on.. not to relive but I like playing music from said times and being in touch with those feelings sometimes (if that makes sense)

test_pid_2404,"Trying to hang in there : I'm going to preface this by saying although I think about dying a lot, deep down I don't want to. I want to grow old and live a normal life. I want to provide for and take care of my parents, I want to eventually get married and have children, I want to enjoy life. 
I feel like like I've been trapped in my mind for so long I never really realized how badly depressed I was. Recently just haven't been able to contain my emotions. I don't want to get out of bed, I don't want to go to class, I dont want to work, I want to pursue my one of passions but I'm losing the motivation to continue. I often find myself fantasizing about what if I was a different person. What if I had different attributes, what if I had the attributes that I want and I was able to be the person I want to be? I increasely find myself looking in the mirror wishing I could change myself and reality but I'm stuck here as is. I wish I could've been going to school to become a doctor/lawyer/engineer but I'm not smart enough. I wish I couldve had a fulfilling relationship in my life but I never have and feel unlovable. I wish growing up kids were nice to me. Instead I'm in college and still dealing with the emotional trauma I have from being heavily bullied. I wish I could go back and unmeet people who did me wrong. I wish I still had some people in my life I cared about. I wish my social anxiety would stop flaring up everywhere I go, but I feel everyone I meet hates me. I wish I could meet my own standards for myself, I wish I didnt have the weight of the world on my shoulders. I wish I didn't think about dying so much. I know despite coming up short on every goal in my life I still have a lot to live for, but at the same time I don't want to. I wish I didnt have these intrusive thoughts. I wish I could tell my darkest secrets to get them off my chest. I wish I could be stronger in faith but I've strayed far from it. I get scared thinking about what I might do to myself if my depression ever gets to a point where I can't handle it. Honestly I wish I had a shoulder to cry on but how can I do that when everyone around me themselves are crying and depressed? How can I do that when I struggle to trust and confide in people? I feel like I'm losing my sanity and I need to reconnect with reality. I want to stop hating myself and but I've made myself the best version of my self I can be and I'm still not happy with who I am. I'm also very embarrassed about my actions these past few years. I went from being a good little kid to smoking, drinking, and fucking all behind my parents back. I often wonder why I make the decisions I make but I feel like I naturally gravitate towards them, as if I can't stop myself from making bad decisions. I'm scared for my future. I want a successful one but I feel my mental health may prevent that. 
I also constantly feel that my feelings are invalid, as if I'm being a pussy. I tried to take myself to counseling but I told myself I was being a pussy at the door and that life is something I have the mental strength to handle on my own. I still dont know if I was lying to myself. Sometimes I feel like I'll get through all this on my own, but sometime I beg and pled with myself to walk into counseling and ask for some fucking help. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND MY OWN EMOTIONS. I really don't, I dont know where I stand. I feel like screaming at god for help but I can't even convince myself to pray. It's my family that keeps me going. Although my parents have typical immigrant mentality they've been good parents and are the main reason I don't hurt myself.
I dont know what the hell I'm doing with my life nor do I know the direction its heading. I guess the only thing I can do is sit here, bump to some Xxxtentacion, and tell myself it gets better. I assume it does, I hope it does. Sometimes I'm optimistic but if I fall back into depression I see world through a dark and gloomy lens. I'm trying to keep a clear pair on.

Im in high school, male, grade 12. All i want to say is that im sick and tired of sleeping 5-6 hours everynight when i shoukd be getting at least 10 hours, im sick and tired of going to school for over 7 hours every single fucking day and learning about boring ass shit that not only doesnt interest me, but that i will forget as soon as i step out of the school. Ive gotten a job recently, which the money is great, but its insanely boring, and often stressful with no reward. What i mean by that is my boss stresses me out by telling me all these things i have to do with no time to do them all, and even when im able to work my ass off and finish i dont even get a ""nice job"". Plus working 6 hours after 7 hours of school is not only tiring as hell but annoying because i have no time to do anything that im actually interested in. I dont think im depressed, i just want life to be different. I want to be 30, living with the love of my life, having a kid or 2 on the way, and waking up every morning feeling rested and excited to go to work, whatever that job may be. I know being tired doesnt seem like a big deal, but for the past 4 years of my life ive been growing and therefore need twice as much sleep as the school system allows me to get, resulting in me feeling not just grumpy but pissed the fuck off when i get up and all day until i get some fucking sleep on the weekends.

test_pid_2413,"If I didn't have such high expectations, would I not be depressed by now ? : 22F , I have about 8 hours deadline to submit my final thesis for college but honestly I dread doing so.
Ever since little I don't think I ever was given the chance to dream. My mom constantly talks about young people becoming young CEOs and have their own companies, so I assumed that was what was expected of me. My older brothers had issues with their lives and have somewhat decent jobs (my mom thinks their job is crap), but I guess my mom was disappointed in that because she invested so much in them. I took that as a signal that I'm the last shot to restoring the family name I guess. I planned out my whole life since I was in middle school, planned stuff like joining the student council, enroll in the best high school, be the smartest in school, get a scholarship, graduate with at least a 3.5 GPA and work a 9 to 5 job and rise up the ranks until I die. So far it has been on track, but honestly, I don't feel the least bit happy about it. 
I was so tired, like every milestone I reached I had sacrificed everything a kid should have, like friends, fun, a sense of identity. And after all that, I would expect my mom to shut up about her expectations and say ""Congrats ! You've done great !"" , but instead she just says ""More ! You aren't the best yet!"" I swear, the more I do this, the more I ask why does it even matter. I am working my ass off for who knows what. Everything I do is a chore and the more I do stuff the more I want to lie in bed and do nothing. I just want to rest. A really long rest where I can try to find a goal, dream, my sense of identity, just fricking anything to give me reason to keep going. And perhaps I can lower my expectations a lot, so I wouldn't feel like a disappointment whenever I failed like before.",2

People will say to talk to other people whose brain is atypical then as if they will have the answers, but it's all the same because the problem isn't the ADHD or the obsessive nature of my mind, or the tremors and night time twitching, it's not the tics or the tantrums or the emotional baggage I bring with me every day.

I'm never going to concede to those arrogant fucks that try to tell us the problem is perspective, I'm not interested in tricking myself into believing things are good enough.

She has been married for quite a while now and always had a boyfriend in uni. IRL we were just acquaintances, not even friends really. But I really liked her. She has a wonderful cheerful personality, you can often hear her joking and smiling, she's just such a cute girl. So yeah, the dream. For some reason, in this dream we were walking somewhere together in the evening and were admiring beautiful architecture of the city. Then (she's on my left) she embraces my right shoulder and I really feel it (and I'm pretty sure no one has ever embraced me like that IRL). It felt wonderful and the I did the same to her. Then, she started telling me how things are not working out between her and her boyfriend and that I shouldn't be concerned about him in case things between me and her started developing into a full on relationship. And then the dream ends. A bit fucked up, considering she's happily married, at least I'm pretty sure about that. I suppose that's my brain projecting some sort of fantasy scenario, but why tho.

test_pid_2425,"Not exactly sure what the move is🧐 Also I write a lot and not afraid to share personal details. Hoping someone sees this and has advice or can relate to what I’m going thru :) : I’ll start off by saying I’m 19. Life recently has been up and down. I’ve never been the slightest bit suicidal or had thoughts about that kinda thing. My childhood and early teenage years were pretty conventional, humble but I can look back and definitely say I enjoyed that period of my life. I’ve always been told by a lot of different people that I’m really funny and have quick wits and I’m fun to be around but at the same time was always kind of a loose cannon. During certain periods of my life I’ve been very opinionated about certain things which has gotten me into some sticky situations, but that’s beside the point.
Over the last year or two, I’ve noticed that my mental state is being very weird. My main issue is that I really don’t feel any positive feelings anymore if that makes any sense. I feel apathetic to almost everything around me. Things I used to do/experience don’t give any sort of pleasure. The music I listen to would physically give me goosebumps and put me in a trance now don’t get that nearly as much, the sports I watch don’t put me on edge at all anymore, when people compliment me or when good things happen to me I don’t get endorphins or any euphoria. Intimate contact/ sex doesn’t do as much for me. There are times I can actually tell that I feel inadequate. Whenever I’m in public or even around more than a handful of friends, I get flooded with anxiety. I feel petrified in my own skin for some bizarre, awful reason. I forget to smile, I can’t come up with relevant/funny things to say, I always feel like the secondary option/sidekick to the people I’m with. If I’m at a party or something, I feel like all eyes are on me in a bad way and I’m afraid to approach people even if I’ve known them and have spoken to them in the past. I don’t feel this way all the time. It’s mostly just in certain social situations whether it’s at school or even at a friend’s house with people I’ve known since the beginning of highschool so like 5-6 years. 
Like I said this social anxiety of sorts started somewhere around last summer. Ever since then I’ve felt fatigued, unmotivated, and scared to expand my social bubbles. For example when someone on Snapchat asks me to hang, unless I’ve known them a while I get nervous. Like really really just not wanting to. The feeling is very difficult to describe. I only mention it as noteworthy because that’s not at all how i used to feel about social situations or most situations in general. 
And I’m not gonna lie some days I do feel ugly. It’s weird I know I shouldn’t and kinda in a way feel petty and stupid for feeling like that but it’s what I truly feel sometimes. 
I feel like a lot of these problems stem from a few bad habits and over indulgence on my part such as me having been smoking weed since I was about 17 years old and the masturbation/ porn watching is probably right on queue compared to other boys/guys my age.
But yeah if anyone has any thoughts/suggestions/comments please absolutely share them I spent about half an hour typing this at 3 am and still feel like there’s more I can talk about but feedback is fully welcome.",2

test_pid_2432,"I really don’t know what to do. : It’s been a constant struggle with my dad and it’s just been getting worse in the past 2 years. We had to go to court because I haven’t went to school once this year nor talked to any of the staff. I drove away all my friends by ignoring them, I haven’t brushed my teeth they are starting to hurt, I don’t even take a shower once a month, I don’t go outside unless it’s to take my dog out, I have the worst anger issues, social anxiety, and depression I’ve ever had and it’s only getting worse.
I keep telling myself it’s gunna get better but I’m not sure how long I can wait. I was gunna tell the real truth into why I really stopped going to school but I made myself believe it was because of the school either because I have such a dependency with my phone because it’s the only thing I look forward to. I have the worst diet because I don’t eat anything home cooked because I have some MAJOR ass trust issues.
I haven’t really had a suicidal thought in awhile because I would tell myself I have a future no matter how long I have to wait, but now I’m really thinking about how long my recovery process will be from all the trama I’ve been in. Every time I argue with my dad he just kinda ignores me if I don’t say anything. I have to say something for him to say anything unless he’s talking about some joke he said that was sooo funny.
I go to Reddit looking for answers but again I don’t use them at all because I’m not that easy. I’m so mentally fucked up you nobody can help me. I most likely won’t kill myself but I’m definitely going back to cutting tonight. And if I don’t cut I’ll have a stronger urge to kill myself so don’t fucking tell me to do otherwise. 
I literally just throw my garbage and have been doing this for the past year on the ground. So this house is filthy, my teeth are probably fucked, I won’t ever go back with my mom even though she’s a better parent. I have no emotion unless it’s for myself or when I’m watching a movie. The only reason I didn’t “fuck over my dad” is because I’m so goddamn dependent on my phone because it’s the only thing that brings me any sense of joy. 
I tried fixing my dad for the past 2 years but he is manipulative, he is abusive, he is in denial. He pushes things off like it’s nothing when I’m crying out for help to him. The deals I made with my dad not to fuck him over were simple yet he hasn’t followed through on any of them. I’m pretty sure I have heart disease and I’m only 16. I want a life but I’m never gunna get it. I just can’t bring myself to do anything. Not even with all the support I get from Redditors. All of my dads friends support my dad. If we went to family therapy it would just turn into a argument because my dad doesn’t wanna look like a bad dad because he actually believes he’s not. When I was 12 I tried to kill myself and I thought I survived because I was meant too. But that was a just a failed attempt. So I didn’t tell anyone. Then my brother tried to kill himself like a year and a half ago in the middle of the day. My dad drove my brother to suicide(he’s still alive) and he joked about it. 
I just want it all to end, I’m in pain both physically but mostly mentally. I’m way too self conscious to do anything. My dad just can’t even talk to me about fixing our relationship. He doesn’t even try. I know he just wants to get rid of me and I think I should do just that. Maybe it would show him to be a better person. But then again he would probably just joke about it. I don’t wanna kill myself but that’s what’s he’s driving me to do I don’t wanna give him that satisfaction but I’m trying my hardest here. I have almost zero goddamn free will.
I’m literally tearing up rn and my dad doesn’t even notice even tho he’s like 7 feet away when I’m writing this. Or he does and he just doesn’t care. I just want to get a job save up and get the fuck out of here but I can’t. I can’t do it, I just fucking can’t. My phone is the only thing I have, it’s the only thing I care about and I don’t wanna mess that up by ending up in foster care. 
I just don’t know what to do and I don’t really know what the fuck you guys are gunna do to help me because you can’t I guess I’m just writing this to tell someone. I mean I live in Hawaii. Everyone is so fucking horrible here. I mean the last person I actually trusted took my weed and turn it into the cops didn’t even tell me then ignored me for 2 months and got mad at me when I told him how I felt. He was the only person I had left and he broke his main rule. He was my favorite person in the entire world the only person I thought I could trust. Everyone is so fucking fucked up here. Everyone’s either a psycho, something mentally wrong with them, something fucked up going on In their life, addicted to drugs, sex addicts, sociopath, overly nice, and some like normal people but mostly those other things I said.
Ok I’m done being a cunt I’m going to got cut myself to make me feel better(haven’t done so In like 2-3 years but thanks dad you have yourself to blame)then not reply to any comments I get unless I do but I already know I’m not gunna kill myself so don’t worry unless you don’t like most people because most people are fucked up people and don’t have any sympathy or empathy and are selfish as fuck. Basically like me because I’m so emotionally desensitized when it comes to other people. Kinda like how 3 people died in my family and I really didn’t care if I’m being honest especially my grandpa because he was a complete psychopath like he pointed a gun at my face once and my dad wonders why I hate him so much. I wish he was buried so I can keep my promise on pissing on his grave. You know at this moment in my life I don’t think I would cry even if my mom or little brother died. That’s how fucked up I am now. I used to cry thinking about my family dying but now I really only care about myself and how I feel. When I get the perfect chance I’m making sure my dad goes to prison because that’s what he deserves. Trust me abuse isn’t the only thing he’ll be going to prison for.",2

test_pid_2436,"I'm trying (and failing) to accept that I'm going to be alone forever : 30M. This year, I lost contact with all of my friends. And I mean all of them; I have no contact with anyone, anywhere, as if I died and nobody told me. All relationships have failed, and where this started as ""there is no one in this world for you, you don't get a soulmate, you don't get love or happiness"" has grown to encompass everyone, as in friendships, not just relationships. I mean sure, I'm sure I could find someone just as lonely as me and we stay together just because we don't wanna die alone, because we know sooner or later our health will begin to fail and we need someone to drive us to the doctor, visit us in the hospital, take care of us at home, and so on, but no, I don't think I will ever be loved. And I will never have real friends, I've never had them anyway.
I realized I've been this lonely all my life, as I posted something today about still having imaginary friends, a group of 5-7 very close-knit guys and girls that do everything together, have the same interests, basically that friendship network we all wish we had, and how this is a coping mechanism for how lonely I've always been. I've never had friends, never had a large family, so they became the friends I never had and will never have. In real life I could drop dead as we speak and no one would even notice, much less care.
I'm gonna be like this forever, I think. And I tried to tell myself that I need to love myself enough to not need anyone else, to not need friendship, love, sex, intimacy, to learn to not need another human being for anything, to accept that this is my lot in life and I'd best just deal with it, but I am failing to do so. It honestly breaks my heart, and as I realize just how lonely I really must be, it makes me want to cry.
No one wants to be so alone. No one should be so alone, but life's not fair, is it.
My mother is the only person I have left in this world. Part of me wants to just move back in with her and accept that she is the only friend and woman I'll ever have in my life, and just focus on being the best son I can. And when she dies - her health is falling - I should follow her out. Because then I really will be alone, so why bother staying here? Why bother staying alive? 
I don't know. I just realize I'm very alone and very lonely and I tried to be strong and accept my fate but I don't think I can and wtf I'm 30 years old and still have imaginary friends as some sort of sick and twisted coping mechanism for the friends I'll never have in real life and I'll never find love never find friendship and this all really just breaks my heart because I don't know what I did to deserve this and I know life isn't fair and sometimes you just have to make the most of it but no one should ever have to be so alone",2

test_pid_2441,"free : From many years back, I met a kid. He had a hard time trying to blend in with the crowd, he was nothing but a pain in the ass. He sucked at everything. He fails to step up on times needed, he always goofs around, not giving a damn about anyone or anything. He argues a lot, a loud mouth and a bully. But within the reckless, troublesome kid I saw something different. He was nothing but a kid who was looking for a place to unravel his true self. Away from all the accolades, recognition and gratification from the outside world. To be free is all he wanted to be. All his life, he did nothing but try to bring the best of himself to make people happy. But that was not what he needed. He had to stop portraying an image, away from what he truly was. He taught me that the first step in solving any problem, was to accept that you have one. With that we can accept things for what they truly are. Letting go of all expectations, all standards and just let life move us freely alongside itself. He made me learn that life is so much more than just money, awards and achievements. The death of this young man has really taken a piece of me away. He has given me lessons that I might never be able to forget. Living life for him was all in the tiny moments, the things we don't usually pay attention to. He showed me that without cold rainy nights, we can never appreciate warm summer mornings. We will never value victories without losses, and having a friend wouldn't be meaningful if you never lost someone. So far, this is the greatest lesson I've learned. We are all bound by the waves of fate. So instead of running from it, why don't we just let it take us? Cry with despair on sad days and giggle like a child on light times. In this world, nothing is truly guaranteed, so live in the moment. And just let life move you through it's course.",2

Ive always been the stoner loner type. never really made many friends but ive always kinda preferred that. i look back fondly on those days where i could be alone.

so now im in a fucked position where i have to either let them sublet (which is it's own set of problems) or tell them no deal lets find somewhere else. the problem im kinda living in the cheapest place around already, and well if my friend's credit wasn't anything to go off of...
and so i ask, IS THIS SO CRAZY? to just do one last ""fuck it"" move and just bail on this entire operation and just live in my car? The obvious answer is ""yes that's crazy, you'd be homeless and think about your friends and family.""

I'm 21, and I've been single my entire life. I live in a world with friends who are changing out relationships every couple weeks, telling stories of their love lives and the amazing women they've had a chance of being with. It affects me daily, because I know I will never experience those things.
I've tried online dating, I've tried going to bars, I've tried just approaching people in college and none have ever worked. I get 2 matches a month while my friends get hundreds. Keep in mind were all just average looking, so it's not like I have warts and sound like Trump while they're Bruce Waynes.
I think I'm just unlovable. The people which I've thought I've had chances with just wanted me for attention or free food. People who love my compliments but then go to other guys for relationships even though I was open with them telling them I wanted to try something out.

Don't play with fire, you are fragile.  These stories are often really difficult. Learn from this community, then implement simple goals in REAL life with REAL people.
So thank you for all your advice, and stories. I am moving on because things are starting to get better because i set simple goals for my next two years and have asked my parents to hold me to them and emailed them the plan.
If you are suffering, look on youtube how to improve your life and find a career, ask God for help, have a friend hold you to goals you set for yourself. Make it real. Email them the plan and ask them to hold you to it and encourage you on that path.
That's the best advice I can give you.

test_pid_2474,"Free : This story is meant to educate others on what happens when people are left alone for too long.
Hi, Im Nolan, and this is my story, before I die. 
I am currently in Highschool and probably won’t make it till graduation. When I was younger, around 5, I liked trains and dinosaurs.  I liked pizza and watching movies, Playing in my backyard, petting my cat. I went to a catholic school, at first. I never had any friends, everyone always avoided me and treated me like shit. I was too young to notice. 
Then I was chosen to switch to another class, several weeks into grade 2, losing everything I was familiar with. It turned my world upside down and I expressed that I didn’t like it to teachers and my parents. My parents tried to get me back into my old class but the school refused. My grades then plummeted, which was unusual since no one ever gets bad marks in early grades, since it’s considered so easy. Having that little friends and no one who ever talked to me I became desensitized to others, having no contact with other kids. 
My grade 3 teacher was lazy and a terrible teacher, she told my parents I needed adhd meds. When i was on them my attention was worse and I would eat my clothing. I would get into to trouble and break other people’s things, not knowing what I was doing. Other kids would yell at me, telling me to shut up. I would sit by myself and collect rocks. Sometimes a kid named Ethan would talk to me, but only when he had no one else to talk to, and when it was convenient. I wasn’t old enough to see this, all I saw was someone who was interested in me for once. Older kids would bully me, I remember once they spit on a rock and handed it to me. I turned it over and saw the bubbly spit and threw it away. It hit a car and my parents and the older kids were charged 50/50. I found minecraft and started playing it, it was a way to escape my sad life. They took me off the meds after grade 3. 
In grade 4, I ended up with the teacher all the kids would complain about, saying she was terrible. I was also with completely new kids who I wasn’t familiar with, and Ethan was in another class. The principle knew most of the kids at the school, and knew I was with a grumpy teacher, and with no one i knew. She did nothing about this. My parents had had enough with the shitty school and terrible staff, so I was moved to a public school. So for grade 4 I changed to a public school, I never had any friends in grade 4 either. I did meet a kid who already had a friend group of 4 and they didn’t want me in it. At this point I was desperate, so I clung to them and followed them around, no matter how many times they told me to go away. I was teased all year, the friend group was bullied since I started being near them. I did that for all of grade 4, still receiving Cs and Ds. 
In grade 5, the friend group broke, 1 leaving, and I slipped in, and they tolerated me, too tired to try and get me to leave. I invited them to my birthday party in effort to get them to like me. 1 declined, saying he’d rather see it with his family, after getting the invitation with time and place on it. Then he came with his dad and literally spies on my party, both of them laughing at me and peeking around corners. (Yes I’m serious.) they even booked seats behind the party row, and talked to all the other people I invited, no one talking to the guy who invited them. I also met some batshit crazy girl, who said she liked me and wanted to have sex with me. I was wierded out, and she never kissed me or anything. I told my parents and she got in trouble, we never talked again. She moved on to making out with kindergarteners. 
From grades 4-5 I had decent teachers, but my grade 6 teacher was the worst. He was the kind of teacher to do team captains and let the unpopular kids be last. I was also targeted by a kid named Yousef. He would make fun of me having no friends and me eating by myself. He would shove me on the ground and elbow me in the back of the head. The teacher did nothing. The principal did nothing. Kids would tell me words I didn’t know, (cuz I was dumb and didn’t know shit) they’d tell me to point my middle finger up, and  tell people I was gonna rape, not knowing what any of that means. I would get in trouble for it, and the kids how told me to, wouldn’t. Eventually the friend group of 3 broke up, and I just followed around one of them, who would create imaginary worlds with me, he never really wanted me there, I was just someone to imagine things with, it didn’t matter who it was, but it made me happy all the same. We made imaginary stories, walking up and down the stone path in the school field, making ourselves Pokémon, or wizards, or people with superpowers. I saw him as a friend, he saw me as someone to get story ideas from. And that’s is what we did from grades 6-8. 
Grade 7, I realized I had to rise above others, there must be something about me that makes people avoid me and hate me. So I studied. I rose from Cs to Bs. I got bullied by a different person, named Hassan, he called my dad a dog, punched and shoved me, insulted me, and ultimately started my way into depression and suicidal thoughts. 
Grade 8 I rose from Bs to As, I sat by myself, after trying to get friends for so long I gave up. I talked to no one and just did my school work. The guy who would walk with me wanted to escape, even he was bored of me, but I would hassle him till he played more. I graduated elementary, and my depression got worse. I started thinking more serious suicide plans. I spent the summer missing when I was young and innocent. 
I started Highschool, grade 9, the guy I walked with had finally moved to the popular people, and was glad to be rid of me. I took music and sewing and cooking in hopes of meeting a girl. I ended up just liking the courses and everyone treating me the same. Avoiding me and not giving a shit, not wanting to have a conversation. I tried to see a psychiatrist but talking didn’t help. Neither do the meds. I rescued 5 duck eggs which were abandoned, and I eventually had to give them to a farm since it was illegal. This made me ever more depressed. 
Now in grade 10 I take more cooking, and music. I’m learning Guitar and Spanish. Still everyone hates me and doesn’t care less if I died. I have thoughts of shooting up the school, or murdering and raping people, as revenge for my terrible lonely life and the poor hand I was dealt. I plan on doing any of these things and then killing my self. Ironically, by train, what I loved so much as an infant will now set me free.",2

test_pid_2476,"Help me, I'm slowly turning into a mysoginist piece of shit and I don't know what to do. : I don't know where else I could post this, and this sub is where people have always been nicer to me. It relates to my depression, as I feel this issue worsens it. If anyone thinks I should post this somewhere else, I'd love to hear your suggestions.
I had a very bad, traumatic experience with psychological abuse coming from a woman I used to be in a relationship with. She gaslighted me for years, and then falsely accused me of abuse to try to make me look bad. That isn't what's been ""turning"" me, but it relates to the problem. Over time, other women I opened up with have either tried to minimize it, deny it or call me a liar and a piece of shit for trying to ruin a woman's life because I ""couldn't accept the break up"".
As time went by, I simply gave up trying to open up. It only made things worse. Instead, I do my best to be kind to people and see how that goes. It hasn't worked either. That has led to women calling me weak, pathetic, and a ""typical man: either an abusive monster or a blob who wants a woman to lead his life for him"".
Lately, all the women I try to talk to are either distant, trying to avoid me or assume I only want to try and get laid (that's obviously not the case, I just want to make new friends). It's been increasingly hard to not get angry at women in general. In the last couple of years, women have gaslighted me, tried to convince me that I am a monster simply for the way I was born and even accused me of abuse to get away with their own abuse. 
Women have done to me a lot of what they claim to be trying to fight with feminism. And I know how it sounds when I say things like that. That's why I'm asking for help. I used to be a progressive person, but lately I've been identifying more and more with those stupid, sexist memes from incel forums and things like that. It's awful and I feel awful for it, but I simply have no history of women not being complete assholes to me.
What do I do? I feel like my efforts to be a better man are only valid if I'm attractive enough. Otherwise, I'm deemed a liar or pathetic. 
I once saw a trans woman ironically respond to a tweet that claimed ""men are monsters from the moment they're born"" by saying something like ""Oh yeah, there is no such thing as a good man. The only two ways out for men, then, are to become incels or suicide.""
I really feel like that's true for a lot of women nowadays. I have gotten past the suicidal tendencies, so now what's left? I don't want to become a mysoginist piece of shit incel.",2

I am roughly insecured that most of them are brave and smart enough to have partners, drink alcohol, effortlessly open up a topic in a conversation , pass exam without even trying to study, and being attractive human being. I really think they're great and fun to hang out with. They're caring even tho I sometimes don't open up problems that much. I don't see anything bad about my extrovert buddies. I am really losing my mind for hating who I am. 
I dont like the way I look, think, act or even speak because I stutter a lot. I want to kill myself. My parents think I'm dumb, my mother always compares me to someone's daughter. My father is suffering from financial problems but kept making me feel that I'm useless inside this house. He wont even allow me to be alone in my room, I cant have time to cry to pour out this heavy feeling inside me.
I have good academic results, I passed 2 of my major subjects. I am still not happy about my life. It feels like not appreciating everything that meant to be appreciated and its hard to live in this constant shithole that I'm living in. 
No one even likes me, no one thinks i'm attractive,  no one sincerely told me that I'm beautiful. No one thinks I'm good at anything.

test_pid_2484,"Says your childhood messes you up : Growing up in an unstable household where your mother was always unpredictably extremely anxious/ready to cry/crying and where you could tell you father was angry by just feeling it from the way he was carrying himself but you had no idea when he would blow up makes you such an awkward, cautious adult. You spend your entire childhood walking on eggshells, constantly scanning the emotional field or feeling of your household, so you could prepare for or prevent your dad blowing up or your mother crying... constantly making sure people aren’t mad, or are okay ... and then you turn out like me, insanely sensitive to you significant other’s every single mood, facial expression, tone of voice, even text. Every little mood change could mean they’re upset, and it could always somehow be your fault. Like it’s your job to protect them and do damage control. It’s exhausting and hard because if you’re like my SO, it can be really annoying to have someone constantly (and basically unintentionally) trying to gauge how they feel and address it and fix it... and like I get that it’s annoying.

test_pid_2485,"Thinking about the upbringing of others : I always think about the millions of people out there that aren't going through any of the bullshit in my life and are doing well for themselves. People always talk about the genetic lottery which I've definitely lost, but I always wonder how many others ended up with being born to shitty parents and forced to grow up around shitty people, while others had it all go relatively alright just because of how they were born. I'd be so much better off if I was born around different people and raised under better circumstances. So fucking unfair how many people slip through the cracks and have no choice but to grow up in complete bullshit that no one should have to experience. The amount of manipulation, stress, and heartbreak in some lives is nowhere near what I've gone through and I wish I could have that. It astounds me when I see people smiling and sharing their joy with friends. It seems far-fetched and unreal. I still hope for a life where I'm finally away from everything causing me pain and around people who care about me, while I work on myself and become successful. But I'm also scared of something like that because I can't remember the last time I was truly happy, and achieving such a life would probably make me feel like I'm finally starting my real life. This is why I've always felt like I haven't really ""grown up."" I wish I could restart it all on my own terms and willingly forget everything that happened in my life before that moment, if it even comes, until there's no trace of the pain I used to live in.",2

There is so many ways to help coping with this darkness. Meditation, being active (sometimes to to the point where it becomes an obsession), breathwork, psychedelics, therapy and many others. 
Sometimes, I come here to read your posts and my heart breaks how many people are suffering and don't have proper coping mechanisms. Life isn't easy, I would say it's very hard for most people but also most people are not willing to put work into making their lives better. 
Become obsessed with something, learn new thing, get out of your comfort zone and for gods sake change the pattern! 
Some people will say that depression is preventing them from doing all those things and I agree to a certain point but give it a shot. Maybe it's not as bad as we think. Maybe it's just an illusion!

This is why I highly recommend people spend time isolated and reflect upon what it is they value most of all. Align your morals and ethical code so you can function in the real world as an individual and not as apart of a group. Being a part of a group is a sure way to stagnate.

test_pid_2494,"Paranoid : I am in a long term, loving relationship with a beautiful, funny, smart, and overall perfect girl. Whenever I express my concerns to her, she assures me that they are completely invalid and that my head is just doing that thing that it does.
But basically, she has been very busy lately (many extracurriculars, two jobs, issues with her family), so we've only really been able to hang out once in the last month or so. I know that it's because she's just busy. But I still can't shake that her feelings for me aren't what they used to be. I've told her that I'm worried, and she always says that I have no reason to be, and I believe her. I just have this constant feeling in the back of my head that she's getting ready to leave me, and I'll be completely alone again.
I've held for awhile now that when (not if) she leaves me, my life will lose its final purpose, and I'll make my last decision with a clear conscious.
These worries are compounded by the fact that whenever she needs me most because of a struggle with her friends or family, I get scared and ignore her messages. I know it's a horrible thing to do, but I have a bad habit of selfishly making situations about myself without even meaning to, and I don't want to say the wrong things. I know she realizes when I suddenly stop texting her, and I'm sure she wishes I wouldn't, but I'm too much a coward. I completely fail at the main thing of a relationship, that being to support her, and I know that she recognizes that.
I've also for months been having the stupid, selfish thought that I want her to break up with me so that I can finally end my life. I've even thought about breaking up with her for that sole reason, despite being ""happy"" with her.

Hope you’re getting through today ok and you’re doing what you feel that you need to do. 
I need a bit of help on what’s the best way to be with someone with depression. I’ve only had minor experiences with ‘it’ in my life and I’ve got mechanisms and routines that have made a night and day difference as to how I feel and it’s been transformational. 
However, there’s someone who I’m talking to at the moment who suffers a lot more than myself and although I understand, I feel a bit lost as to how I can support or talk to her.

I find myself not wanting anything anymore, no career, relationships, not even happiness.
But today's different. 
Today I don't feel this overwhelming pressure caving in on me. I feel - *okay*. It's a jarring feeling, going from thoughts of death before bed for *months* \- to waking up laughing at the little things. I don't even understand this feeling anymore or what it even means. I can still feel the thoughts in the back of my mind. But something, at least for today, is holding them back, I can physically feel it. It's like a barrier in my head, shielding me from the outrageous thoughts. Although, through the mirage I still have fear. Fear it all comes rushing back - a river of endless thoughts I might drown in.
But not today.
Today I feel aware. Aware that these negative thoughts aren't real - aware that contentment/happiness *is* real. 
It's like my senses are in overdrive, going from complete numbness to euphoria at the simplest things.

test_pid_2503,"Starting Effexor after precious doctor set me up for failure : Hello everyone,
This is my first Reddit post ever, didn’t think it would end up here lol. But anyways, I’ve always been an anxious person, but had always managed myself well. I workout everyday, am honest with friends and family etc. I do a lot for my mental health. I vaped/smoked heavily and quit December 16th cold turkey as I knew it wasn’t good for my anxiety in the long run. Anyways, I constantly worry about minuscule things, but it finally caught up with me when I started dating my new girlfriend and got severe performance anxiety. I was so anxious I couldn’t get in the mood, and it made things really tough. I was really down on myself for a while, and finally decided to see my doctor (around New Years) and talk about it. He recommend Paxil (10mg which would eventually go to 20mg) and also gave me viagra (keep in mind I’m 21 M, so this is very unlikely needed). I was anxious from the start of taking Paxil because I read about the increased risk of sexual side effects with it. Although it did help with my anxiety, I completely lost all interest in sex. I messaged my doctor and was telling him about the symptoms, but he ignored email, after email. I began to feel hopeless, worthless, and thought about not being here a lot. 2 weeks ago I decided to try a new doctor on my college campus (UNH). When seeing him, he was very helpful. Since then I’ve started counseling/therapy for managing my anxiety, which has been very helpful, and even managed to ween off Paxil. But I still felt hopeless as I still had no
Libido and was constantly worried about my girlfriend thinking less of me (I know she wouldn’t, she’s very supportive I’m just in my head). After lots of surveys, blood tests to rule out other possibilities, and long emotional conversations with my new doctor, he determined I was moderately to severely depressed (not surprising as I’m a junior in a mechanical engineering curriculum). I have to wait another week to start Effexor as I was still weening if Paxil this week, but am excited. I’ve heard lots of good things about Effexor. I’d really like to not feel so stuck anymore. To enjoy being out with friends again, have the motivation to work hard again, and maybe to feel passionate about my relationship again. I know there’s still a lot of work to do, and sexual counseling may be necessary to get me out of this sexual funk. But I figured I’d share part of my story for anyone who may need to hear it or is going through the same thing. Not all doctors care. Hope everyone can find peace of mind and know you’re not alone.

I've struggled with depression and anxiety all my life, even as a child. Until over a year ago I just didn't know what to call it, because to me it was just normal, I just thought that's the way everyone views life. It took me almost a year to get from knowing I need help, to searching for help, to getting blocked from help because I must be an addict, to getting help.
I'm in a better place now than I was six months ago thanks to a great therapist and psychiatrist that takes me seriously and a supportive wife and daughter.
I'm 33 with no degree and have been working at the same place for a living for 13 years. Currently working towards various self study certifications to transition into the IT field which has been something I have wanted to do since a teenager. I received no support or guidance on how to reach my goal from anyone in my life and felt lost at sea since I didn't have it all figured out by the end of high school.
Thanks to therapy and meds I've been going as hard as I can on studying, but damn is this hard. I work over 50 hours a week, come home to be a dad and husband, then what little energy I've got left I'm pouring it into these studies for just a hope and a prayer of a career change since I'm competing against people with degrees (even though a degree doesn't guarantee you know what you are doing). 
I'm at war with the dark parts of myself every damn day, pushing back, climbing up this damn sheer cliff wall of regret and hopelessness.

My fantasies about me turning into a black ink drawing and then melting into the floor or blowing away in the wind are coming back, at least not as strong as they used to be though.

I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this I really needed this off my chest :/,2
test_pid_2532,"I really am tired of getting angry at people who don’t deserve it because of my depression : ⚠️Language warning ⚠️ 
Today I(f18) yelled at one of my group members in English we were talking about a book and had are google slides so we can all right something about the book. I didn’t read it because I usually need an audio book and it was hard for me to find and every time I read the book I loose where I’m at and instantly forget what the hell is happening.
So we’re on are tablets in google slides writing down answers for the question “what is New Orleans like?” Everybody wrote most of what I was thinking of and I was trying to think for the longest time what else can I say? One of the said “did you write something?” I said “no I’m still thinking you said most what I was thinking” she replied “well you have to say something while you’re thinking we’re gonna move on.” Which pissed me off because she knows I didn’t read the first chapter of the book yet and she probably thinks I’m a lazy son of a bitch that doesn’t want to contribute even tho I do want to contribute! 
After that the bell rang and she asked again “you know you have to write something down” and I said “I did but but it’s only one word” she said “well you got to write more than one word you can’t just sit there and no do anything” then I got angry and cussed her out saying “well I’m fucking sorry i can’t think of anything else for the question!! I literally wrote something down I am trying my god damn best here!! So fuck off god damn it!!”. 
Then everyone went out to their next classes and I’m still heated and I also regret it because I usually don’t like to be mean to people I’m just depressed and want the day to fucking be over.  I wish I could have apologized 
Sorry had to vent that out..
TL;DR: doing a project about a book in a group didn’t read it we tried to answer a question they said most what I wanted to say couldn’t think of anything but one word got angry because one of my group members thought I was lazy telling me i should do something instead of sitting there even tho I was trying and I got angry and cussed them out. (Probably a bad summary)",2

test_pid_2534,"I tried to reach out... making friends in law school is horrible : So I’m in law school and I moved to a different state for it, and I have been having a really hard time making friends. 
Many of my peers are very privileged and can go out on weekends and spend money at bars, and that was how several got close at the beginning of the year. As I support myself, and at the time I worked on weekends, I never went out. Furthermore, your first year of law school you’re put in “sections” and you have all of your classes with your section. So I have had every class since September with same people. This causes it to be very clique-y and almost reminiscent of high school’s social structure. Which is awful in and of itself. 
I had a friend (I thought) but I turned out she didn’t really care about me at all, and basically just tolerated me and talked about me to her other friends in our section all the time. That was a hit to my self confidence, and now just seeing that group laughing and talking at the beginning of class or leaving together makes me sad. Since it’s halfway through the second semester (basically) everyone else is basically “settled” in their groups of friends, and since I was busy working first semester and thought I was friends with someone, I just kind of ended up on the outside of everything. 
I also recently had some family problems, I lost my job and have financial concerns, and my mental health is getting bad again, which makes it harder for me to put myself out there as it is, because I start over analyzing every interaction. 
I am becoming increasingly lonely, and feel so isolated. 
Yesterday, I tried to reach out to a girl who has been friendly to me in the past, by texting her and asking if she knew what the attendance policy was in one of our classes. She read it but never answered.
I’m honestly really upset. I know it sounds silly, but it did take a lot for me to reach out. And I just feel like I need a female friend... someone I can just vent to like I did my friends from undergrad. My boyfriend is amazing, but he works 9-5 five days a week, with an annoying commute and the last thing I want to do is unload on him and complain as soon as he gets home.
The more isolated I feel the more self conscious I feel and I’m just becoming more and more lonely and anxious. I hate gaps in between classes because I sit in a corner of the library alone wondering what’s so wrong with me. I had a great social life in college.
I don’t know what’s happening to me and I’m just so lonely.",2
test_pid_2535,"I think i'm becoming more violent... : First of all, I'm 24 and I am a guy who prefers being alone. But still I like hanging out with people and I have no problems with being with people. Most of the time, I have literally no conflict with any of my friends. I usually don't cross the line and try to respect others. But recently, I am having a real problem keeping myself. 
I noticed that I am becoming more violent as I started to live with my family. I even almost hit my brother because I could not contain myself at the time. What happened is, my brother makes too much noise at night. I told him more than like 10 times to stop but he still does (my brother has a mental disorder). I really have no idea what I'm doing. I'm starting to yell at my brother more and more, i get triggered too easily these days, and yea I almost hit my brother. I really need an advice or a help for managing myself from anger...

test_pid_2537,"will this ever stop? : my entire life, ever since i can remember i have been told that i have an anger problem. when i was very little i had this very explosive anger. it was never just angry all the time for me, but if i felt like i was in the right there was nothing my mother or father could do to calm me down outside of brute force. i accidentally broke my mothers thumb when i was like 4 or 5. in kindergarten my sisters locked my out of our house and started laughing at me through the frosted glass on the door(we lived in a camper) - so i put my fist through it without even flinching, or thinking about it. a few days later we went to see a dr, and when we all got there(my mother, myself, and 2 sisters) everyone talked in a little room for awhile and then when we were getting ready to go they told me i wasnt leaving. i couldnt go home with my mother, and sisters. i had an anger problem and so i was going to stay there for a little while. im honestly not sure how long i was there, it was  sometime right after school started and i didnt get back until after christmas break, and i could feel every single boy and girl in my class laughing at me and calling me names. since i stayed in the same school till high school i was known as the kid that had to go to the crazy hospital, and always laughing, pointing. always groups of friends for them, and i would never be accepted by them. i played baseball with a few people from class and even they pointed and laughed, spreading lies about me, reminding me that i was crazy. made even worse as soon as i hit first grade because i had scored very well on my IQ test so i went to GT twice a week for half a day. now i am the crazy kid that is also slow. they didnt come with me, and so they assumed i was in remedial classes because those kids had a similar patterns. by middle school still the same, and i dropped out and started self  medicating. eventually i found something that seemed to work, in a terrible way.hydrocodone. it didnt take long for me to graduate to heroin and digging holes in my arm.  as many times as i have tried to quit, i always relapse and its always the same loop. i have been told a million times that it i would just stop with the drugs that it would end. i am now 36 and have been clean for 11 months and the roller coaster only seems to be gaining size. i want to get a job, but the thought of the judgement and laughing behind my back is all i can think. ""nobody in their right mind would give you a job"" ""look at you, clearly a junk box, get out of here"" is what would go though my mind. i cant even go to the dam store anymore. the thought of it all makes me sick. no matter how hard i try, i cant make myself go face them. my family doesnt speak to me anymore because they are rightfully ashamed of me, nor do they believe me.  "" all you gotta do is get off the drugs and all of this will stop. you're doing it to yourself. "" thats what i have heard a million times over. how can i make this end? its not all the time, but most. other days i have so much energy that i could run to the moon, except sex sex sex first. i kind of realized my mood swings have patterns and depending on the day i could have the sex drive of a ""machine"" or its just gone. no in between. im not asking anyone to diagnose me or anything like that, and i have not had any thoughts or hurting anyone nor myself. does anyone know how to obtain medical records in arkansas if the hospital has been long since shut down?",2

test_pid_2551,"Luck runs out : I'm 22 and it feels like my luck has just run out finally. I managed to get into a college prep school on scholarship when I was going into high school. I worked my tail off and got into a pretty good college in a major city on full scholarship. I was involved in my fraternity and won us awards while on exec, I met my wonderful girlfriend, and I had solid internships throughout my time in college. 
I've always fought to get what I want, but now, it seems like I can't anymore. I couldn't find a job in the big city I went to college in for 3 months after graduation, and my majoring in philosophy didn't help (I was too optimistic about majors not mattering and studying something you love). When I finally got one, I pounced on the opportunity. 
At first, things were fine, but now I'm at a point where I dread waking up. When I do, I lay in bed because I don't want to go to work that badly, so I'm late. I'm so mentally drained not from the work itself, but the environment, so when I get home, I don't want to do anything with friends. But I don't want to go to work in the morning when I wake up, so I stay up late which makes me tired—counterintuitive, I know. I don't even want to go out on weekends and I'd rather just lay in bed only to get up for the bathroom or Postmates. I've been lashing out more and more because of a shorter temper now, and even when I realize, I can't suck up my pride and immediately apologize. 
I know compared to other people's problems, this seems minor, but I've never felt this way about anything before. I feel guilty hating my job and wanting another one, I feel guilty not being able to get a better job, and I feel guilty for even feeling down about this. My girlfriend thinks I'm depressed, but coming from an Asian immigrant household, that's never been a thing. It's always been ""Look at how bad other people have it; be grateful and get over it.”

test_pid_2567,"One thing goes another one comes... : In the past 7 months I’ve fallen deep into depression (once again) due to a girl. I’ve opened up first time in my life and I got hurt. I abused drugs and alcohol big time and my behavior took a complete 180 according to my coworkers and friends. A month ago we stopped the affair and I slowly started to heal. As of today I can safely say I’m over one of the worst depression episodes of my life.
Ofcourse life doesn’t give me a fucking break. Back when I was 14, I had a backbone surgery, I have an implant in my back which slightly limits my movement (nothing visible) and my lower back often hurts after sport sessions (when I’m not careful). This week my mood was kinda uplifted and felt generally good. Yesterday I made a slightly off move and my lower back hurts like hell. More than after surgery. I know it will pass in a day or two but damn, it’s one of the worst physical pain I’ve ever experienced. Also painkillers don’t really help a single thing, so I’m fucked. I can barely walk, sit or lie still. Every movement hurts. Last night it almost sent me into another depressive episode: “If I’m having issues like this at 26, who the fuck will risk living their lives with me when there is a risk I might get disabled down the line?”. Nevertheless after going through mental hell in the last 7 months I’ve just shrugged it off and thought, I can still make decisions that can change the course of my future. That’s what I will do.
To me, physical pain has basically became nothing compared to mental issues I’ve had. Now I feel strong and motivated to live my life to the fullest.

test_pid_2570,"I thought the worst was over but I was wrong. Disappointed in our world. : I have been depressed for 10 years, with breaks in between.  
2 years ago I went through hell, got kicked out of uni because of my depression and came out of an abusive relationship.  I was ashamed of my sickness and brought it up too late, got in  trouble, the university decided to kick me out. I could have won against them if I went to court but I had no more energy and money to give them, I wanted to move on and forget.  
I moved, started a new major (got some credits recognized) and less than a year later, I was very depressed again. I talked to university and felt they were more supportive than the last, but it still wasn't easy and I kept feeling worse.  Last November a friend committed suicide and that really dragged me down to a very dark place. I managed to get accepted for a scholarship interview since I am quite involved in extracurricular activities and most of my grades are good. The application was hell because some professors refused help and I was already in a bad place, so I felt alone and like no one believed in me.   
Finally, 2 profs agreed to help me and I felt like someone was supporting me in my path.  
The application process required a lot of tears and energy, I had to reflect on my past and my failures, which still hunt me. My therapist was very busy with me during that time as I felt suicidal, but in the end I was proud I managed to finish it regardless of the depression and constant panic attacks.  
Something unexpected happened: they invited me to an interview, 7 hours away from my home. I accepted, prepared, investing lots of fear and energy into the process. I felt it went well and was hopeful the horrible dark period would end, but I was wrong.  
They don't want me. Other amazing people were not taken, while some ""difficult"" cases got in (girl I saw stealing from supermarket), but overall the majority got in.  
I'm obviously extremely frustrated, I hoped this would be a step into brighter times. I hoped it would mean change. But now I feel very very down, I feel like society has no place for people like me, even though I'm smart, critical and contribute to society. I feel like it's all pointless because society is sick and they don't deserve my help if they can't see my value. I have been let down so many times, while complete assholes are getting free rides (I live in Europe, my parents pay lots of taxes for the free riders). There is no justice, there is no reward.

test_pid_2577,"losing time and memories to depression : i'm sure a lot of you can relate to living life indoors, in front of a screen, passing the time to numb the sadness. i have spent so many years like that- my whole teenage years. the only way i can remember mostly anything positive that happened is through photos. 
i spend 90% of my time alone, trying to numb the anxiety and nervousness and feelings of inferiority. i cannot even remember most of last year.
yesterday i went for a long walk on my favourite trail, i saw so many birds and the sun beat down on my skin and i felt alive. i remember every time i leave the house, or go out in nature- and i ache, because i realise that's what being alive feels like. i want to live properly
because i am so afraid of being around people, every time i leave the house i remember the rapid heart rate, the feeling of being watched, so that's a lot of what i can remember. i miss being young and not being consumed by thought or having my mind influenced by anything, just going outside and feeling like i belong",2

Finally have the courage to speak up in class regarding something? Regret it moments later, overthinking how it sounded to everyone else, and coming to the conclusion that I'm dumb and should not attempt that ever again (which is why in general I do not like talking with others).
Buying and wearing something that seems cool and fashionable in order to feel good about your appearance and boost self confidence? Never touching that piece of clothing ever again, because I keep getting anxious over how it may stand out, and how people may end up thinking that I am pretentious, fake, and a trend chaser. 
Feeling a little productive by having a steady day? Oh, but remember all those times that you failed being productive, all those times that you stayed in bed instead of doing what you were supposed to, and ended up regretting it? Well, regret it now as well, just because you had a productive day doesn't mean you are a productive person.
Lonely? Create a Tinder profile and go out of your way to start conversations. Oh wait, look at all those likes that you did not get!

test_pid_2584,"Zoloft and weight gain? : Hi all, 
So I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder when I was 18 about 7 years ago now. I’ve been on a variety of medications but about 4 years ago I was put on Quetiapine (seroquel XR) for BP2. About 2 years ago I moved to a different city and started seeing a new psychiatrist who changed my quetiapine dosage and put me on 25mg of Zoloft. Since then, I’ve gained about 23lbs in about a 2 month period. My lifestyle hasn’t changed other than that I’ve actually been going to the gym a lot more since I’ve noticed the weight gain. 
I talked to my doc about this and she insists that Zoloft has very little affect on weight gain, and decided to take me off the quetiapine completely, saying that there’s more correlation with that med and weight gain than there is with zoloft. 
My question is, has anyone experienced weight gain with Zoloft? I did some research of my own and there are studied that day there’s correlation. It’s important to note that I also struggle with BED, but that it’s been improving, so I’m not sure how much that has a part in the rapid weight gain. I’m currently the heaviest I’ve ever been in my life and it’s sending me into a spiral. Anyone who’s had experiences like this and has any advice would be greatly appreciated! 
TIA!",2

test_pid_2586,"Would you class yourself as being unwell as a result of mental illness? : I’m interested to hear people’s opinion on the notion of being ‘unwell’ when it comes to mental illness...
I had this discussion a while ago with a therapist and it was quite interesting to see different perspectives of what we mean and define as ‘unwell’... and how it’s possible to become attached to such a notion and idea in a manner that’s detrimental to recovery.
Are there distinctions that can be made between body and mind in the context of ‘unwell’? (E.g. Would you class experiencing a mental health crisis and experiencing suicidal ideation as unwell? Would you class having cancer as being unwell?) When does mental Illness become defined as unwell? Is it a matter of severity? Management? Classification and Type of Mental Illness disorder? 
I’m interested to attempt to make distinctions as I can sort of see where blurring occurs but I don’t feel I’m quite fully comprehending it the distinctions.
To complicate it further you have different schools of thought such as the ‘medical model’ and ‘recovery model’ etc... To me it seems almost a matter of personal opinion however is there a general consensus for distinction? 
We could even consider to make no distinction between the experience of ‘being’... In such a case it’s seem arbitrary whether the brain or body is experiencing being unwell... It’s all part of your identifiable experience of ‘being’... and do we make the distinctions to define the brain and body as mind? It seems to be a matter of personal judgement and opinion... rather philosophical in pursuit. 
It’s interesting... would you only be unwell when you are experiencing severe mental illness or a crisis? And when you aren’t in those states are you simply recovering? Are you well or unwell then? 
I’m interested to hear your thoughts and distinctions, I feel it may help some confusion for me.",2

test_pid_2593,"This is what helped me Overcome My Depression. This will help You Too : Being a sufferer of depression, and finally overcoming it after years of unbearable torture, it is my moral obligation to let others know ""What helped me Overcome My Depression"". 
First let me briefly tell you what I was going through so anyone reading this can relate and know that
 "" I too had faced the same problems that You are facing now. And I did overcome all of this. I did Get Better. And You can Too""
I suffered from depression for 3 years. It was an unbearable situation where my mind would be bombarded with sad/depressing thoughts throughout the day. I could aomehow make it through the day and finally sleep off, only to wake up to the same horror the next day. There were days when I just went to sleep so as to get relief from my monster mind. 
I tried several options to get myself better. I quit smoking, quit alcohol, meditated daily. But nothing was working for me. 
And then finally, when nothing else worked, after years of suffering, I opted to go  consult a doctor for my condition. I was prescribed medications. I took them. And I GOT BETTER.
Sounds simple right? Well that's the catch. People suffer for months and years, but  hesitate to go see a Medical Professional. While you can and should try all sorts of alternate methods to help with you depression, like medication, quitting smoking, alcohol etc., but without Professional Medical Attention the equation to a better mental health remains uncompleted. 
To anyone suffering from depression and contemplating whether to go see a  medical professional, THIS IS THE UNIVERSE TELLING YOU TO GO SEEK MEDICAL TREATMENT.
When you realise that you may be suffering from depression, for whatever reason it may be, its your responsibility to take steps and get out of it. Take Action, Get out of it and Tomorrow you will be advising some other guy to do the right thing. Empower yourself so you can empower others. 
To go through depression is a really painful experience. And one should never suffer silently, especially when there is a way out.

I don't feel anything lately. I don't feel strongly about absolutely anything. I'm very lonely but I don't have the energy to make an effort to make friends or reach out to the ones I have. I love planning and knowing how to prepare but I don't know for sure where I want to go next in life. I know what I need to do on a day to day basis and I know what tasks I have to complete but it's becoming so much harder to do them when I don't see the point. 
I'm not having the classical ""I work for 50 years and then I die"" realization and breakdown. I've already accepted that and want to have a career that's fulfilling so it doesn't feel like hell going to do it and I understand the importance of hobbies and living for the little things. I don't mind working and living for the things to look forward to. It's just that I don't look forward to anything. I can't make myself think positively. An artist I like is coming to town? Overpriced concert tickets and feeling bad about the way I look in public and going alone and dealing with traffic. New show came out with an actor I like? I might not like the show and it'll feel like a waste of time so I might as well rewatch the same thing for the 9th time instead. Everything feels like work and I can't convince myself to do anything. Everything leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I dropped out of school and have my groceries delivered and don't refill my prescriptions or see a therapist or go to a doctor because I can't and don't want to leave the house. It's been weeks since I've left. I feel so empty but most of all I'm mad at myself for feeling that way. 
I also have regular worries like my appearance and feeling like I won't be loved or the people I'm attracted to thinking it's laughable someone who looks like me likes them. And worries about God and religion, as I was excommunicated from my church. Ever since then honestly my life has felt empty. 
I just wish I felt anything again. Even sadness. I don't mind feeling negative emotions, everything is worth feeling. I just wish something was strong enough to make me feel it. 
I don't really need advice. And I don't want someone to talk to. I just kinda wanted to be able to say this and address how I'm feeling without the pressure of being expected to answer for it. I'm so tired.",2

test_pid_2606,"Slipping back down : Idk guys. This post might be me venting about what I've been thinking about a lot recently, but I guess it's becoming harder to find a reason to not kill myself?
Recently I've been getting stuck in my head about how little people really matter to me. One of the mind tricks I do is think about what if ""so-and-so"" was to die? I've thought that losing close friends would just be an inconvenience, but I'd move on, and that my immediate family is who tethered me here.... but recently I cant help but think ""why should i give a shit?"". My family and me have never really been that close (hugging, saying I love you, talking things through, etc...) so it makes sense to me why I dont feel any meaningful connection with them other than them just always being around.
My thoughts are ""I'm the one that has stopped me from killing myself"", ""I'm the person that matters most to me"". Dont get me wrong; I like myself. I'm fairly confident in myself and defienelty know what my weakness are as a person, but if I'm the only one that matters to me, and I'm unhappy, then why wouldn't I want this all to stop?
The idea of ending it does physically upset me (even now as I'm writing this) because it's almost like I really dont want to kill myself, but it just seems like the most reasonable choice. Maybe not now, but eventually. People keep telling me that I'll find a job or something I enjoy, and I do have things I enjoy (excersize and art), but those hobbies of mine dont seem like enough to just keep grinding away through this life. I've really tried to think of a way that I could have a career based on either of those, but nothing sounds enjoyable (like being a manager at a gym) or realistic (like making it big in the art world).
I just dont have goals or motivation to look forward to in the future. I used to think traveling more would be fun, and sure it would, but going on vacation isn't a career. Everything just seems to lead me to a path of working away to make enough to pay the bills, and for what? So I can just continue my hobbies in my small amount of free time and on the weekends?

Im a bad person my friend is a bad person, shes a slut and whore and me hanging with her makes me one too, im gonna cheat, im gonna do this and this and that and blah blah blah.  I drink too much, I party too much, I spend too much time with her.  Im a lesbian now.  Im irresponsible with money.  I spend too much.  How dare I have nice clothes.  I make home cooked meals instead of Jacks frozen pizza every night like he wants.

test_pid_2630,"I think I might be depressed : My ex-girlfriend and I had a very nasty break-up four months ago and ever since then I've felt incredibly bad. My emotions are a complete rollercoaster 24/7; one moment I can feel relatively happy, then a minute later I'm super sad or angry. The littlest things completely fuck up my mood. Nothing excites or surprises me anymore. I barely laugh anymore and when I do it feels forced. I am super bored all the time. Sometimes I wish that I was dead, just so I can escape life's and society's obligations. I feel like everything I do or could do is utterly useless and have no hope of ever finding anyone or anything that will keep me occupied like my ex-girlfriend did. I still want her back even though I somewhat despise her for everything she has done to me. I don't even know why I'm posting this, I guess I just needed to vent.",2
test_pid_2631,"Death &amp; Nihilism : I can't stop thinking about the fact that everything eventually comes to an end.
You can try to picture the ideal life to live: spend years of your childhood learning the basics of life, grow up and earn money anyhow, fall in love, get married, buy a house to start your new family, make sure the children don't die, try your best to avoid diseases, get a disease and eventually die.
Everything seems like a redundant cycle. And I just can't stop thinking about everything. I'm so focussed on the end result of everything that it's difficult to live in the moment; it's difficult to be happy with life when you know you can't keep it forever. The problem is: not getting a satisfying answer to solve it.
Religious people say that I'm lost. I say they are just unaware of themselves being lost, too. God's existence can't make anymore sense than existence itself if God exists...
Atheism doesn't really solve anything either, but at least it doesn't add to the mystery; God would just be another unnecessary layer over it, which slows us down from getting any real answers.
Sharing this here doesn't really make much of a difference. But maybe it'll help to know others understand. I can't really talk to other people about it without ruining the mood.

test_pid_2632,Need your suggestion : Few days ago my office friend told me that he was in a relationship for 7 years before marriage. His parents never approved of their marriage so they got seperarted. He got married to someone else 3 years ago. Had a kid. But he saw his old love few months back. And that girl is also married. He says that those feelings came back again and now he’s being following her since last couple of months. He talked to her once few weeks back but she scolded her badly and asked him not to talk again. But dude is still following her. He can’t get her out of his head. My theory is that he cannot accept the fact she got married and it was a love marriage. Dude can’t sleep and he is not eating well. Any suggestions??,2

HOW TO DO THE WORK
When we are triggered, we are experiencing a wound from the past in the present moment.
Let’s say we are in line at a grocery store. We’re browsing magazines when someone walks right past us getting in front of us, not noticing we are there. The feelings come from the body during this trigger. The thought stream from the ego comes into play “they’re so rude” “typical ignorant person cutting in front of me.” Our ego preservers the core belief about the false (conditioned) self: I am not seen. I am not considered. Then we hook into the emotions of this story, and we’re unconsciously caught in this loop for hours. Sometimes days. If we’re really triggered, we will repeat this story to other people to re-live our emotional addiction to this belief.
Our work is to question. Our work is to observe these stories. To breathe, then consciously choose a new response in alignment with our true self.
Let’s go with a trigger from someone closer, our mother. She makes a snide comment about something we are wearing. We’re triggered. The ego starts talking “She always does this. She’s so critical and wonders why I don’t want to spend time here” or “She’s right I knew these pants aren’t flattering, I need to loose weight.” Our ego preserves the core belief about the false (conditioned) self: I am not worthy as I am. We’ve gone into a spiral of all of the past times our mother commented on our body + appearance. If we remain unconscious, we’ll engage in a predictable dynamic with her. Another way to keep our emotional addictions active. Another way the ego wins.
If we remain conscious and do the work, we will just observe. We will breathe. And pause. Creating space to see that her comments come from her own wound (likely the same patterning said to her by her own mother) then we can choose a new response. We can engage differently, getting a small glimpse of our power beyond ego.
Triggers are teachers. Allow them to be. You’ll allow yourself transformation #selfhealers",2

But the past few months have been hard, we've been arguing a lot, almost every other day and we've blocked each other now countless times.

Im not suicidal or anything but I don't see the point in living this way at the same time.
Im starting to think Id prefer to do something drastic rather than just continuing the ""carrot on a stick on a treadmill"" lifestyle of lower-middle class life. Id rather be poor living life on my own terms than your typical ""tiny cog in the machine"" existence. It kills me Ill never truly get to see the world or get the experiences life offers when you are wealthy. I saw a Vice video years and years ago about ""cowboy capitalism"" in Africa and it honestly seems way more appealing to me than sitting here and living your typical Middle class existence. Wake up early...go to job you hate...come home watch some stupid TV show or sporting event...eat dinner...go to sleep... Do it again the next day. Over and over and over till im dead.

Sorry for rambling but I guess my point is I dont think I csnt handle the monotony of average life. Anyone else think that? I don't want to die necessarily but at the same time I don't want to continue living, not like this.

test_pid_2666,"i feel hated by almost everyone i first meet : An easy answer would be wonderful, but im sure it's for more complicated reasons that im just not aware of and couldnt describe in this post
this might be super boring, so to anyone who reads this through and offers me any possible explanation, thank you.
So at first i thought it was just my social anxiety telling me i was looking into things too much, but I've honestly come to the conclusion that there must be something inherently extremely off-putting about the way i act, especially when I think collectively at all the situations ive been socially rejected. Now i fully understand why someone would come to hate me over time since there's plenty of reasons for that, but it seems that a lot of people almost immediately dislike me. ive never had a single friend throughout all my time in high school, and i didnt have any friends at my job, and now in college i still havent made any friends. but it's not that no one talks to me, people start talking to me sometimes, but very soon after they either stop, or i sense a change of tone, like theyre only talking to me out of pity. off the top of my head, here's some examples from this year that i noticed this pattern of people talking to me then soon after realizing it was a mistake:
\- in one of my first freshman college classes i met a girl, she chatted with me first and repeatedly sat down next to me, but over time i could sense she regretted choosing me to be the person she ""befriended"" for that class. one time we had to work in groups of four, and everyone in the group ignored me when i tried to talk (it's not like i was butting in or something, whenever there was a silence i tried to jump into the conversation, and i did this a few times, and each time everyone else would start talking over me). eventually the girl who normally had to chat with me in the class turned to me and asked me something to let me speak a little, and i could tell that it was because she felt bad for me. So this is an example of someone seeming to be fine with talking to me at first, then their tone shifts to pity.
\- in another of one of my first classes there was a guy who would sit next to me in my bio and chem class, since we had the same one and they were back to back. at first he talked to me super friendly and seemed chatty and nice, and he asked for my number. then literally one class to the next, he suddenly seems to really dislike me. he would still sit in the same row as me and talk a little, but he would always make sure that he was at least one seat away from me, so there was an empty one between us. and i thought that's fine, like i figured maybe he's just a person who likes a good amount of space for elbow room or something. but then i realized that he would sit next to the person to the other side of him without a gap, and if in bio there was no room to make that empty seat between us, he'd make sure he'd move a seat over in chemistry class. idk, this one in particular just really hurt my feelings. he would still talk to me, but his tone shifted, im not sure if it was to a tone of pity or to just trying to not make class awkward. 
\- another dude from class in college who gave me his number, who at first seemed fine talking to me, then suddenly seemed to really dislike me. 
\- all my roommates, especially one of them, almost immediately i got the sense she was pissed off or annoyed with me. and it really wasnt all in my head. she cut any conversation i tried to make as short as possible.
\- literally everyone i ever met in high school, which is very very few, and i always figured that they didnt like me because i had a reputation for being the weird quiet kid, but in hindsight, some of these people also seemed totally fine with me within the first few interactions, then took the shift to seeming to feel sorry for me or annoyed by me. 
clearly there's a pattern here, but the problem is i honestly dont know what im doing wrong. i know plenty of reasons why someone SHOULD hate me, but within the first few surface level interactions i think i cover up my horrible qualities pretty well, so i dont understand how come their tone seems to shift so drastically with me. it's not that i smell, im not strikingly ugly, i dont think, and i pretty much always stick to ""safe"" uncontroversial subjects when i talk to people. i dont know, and i doubt anyone else really can from this explanation either, so what i was wondering is, has anyone ever just felt a ""bad aura"" from someone? like for no particular reason, you just cant help but really dislike them? Im wondering if maybe, despite how hard i try to hide them, my bad qualities somehow manage to seep through into my conversations still, so i just give off ""negative energy"" that people cant really help but dislike, even if there isnt a reason that they can place their finger on. 
 if anyone somehow understands this or has some sort of advice, it's really appreciated.",2

test_pid_2668,"Do you ever turn your phone off, sometimes for days? : I’m dating someone who seems to have done this. His phone has been turned off for almost a day at this point.
I’m definitely not blocked, it’s just been turned off. Before when he’s been depressed, he will go a long time just not replying, but his phone will still be on.  I suffer from depression but personally don’t shut my phone off while I’m that state, so I’m wondering if this is something that you might use to cope?
Little context to him shutting off his phone: last night we were going to watch a movie via video chat. In the middle of us chatting (right before we were about to video), he stopped reading my messages suddenly. I kept messaging but they weren’t getting read. Over the course of an hour,  Instagram showed him as active/online a few times, but he wasn’t opening my messages. I guess he was out of it, or likely just talking to someone else....I’m still confused.
Either way, I started to worry. He is also prone to serious seizures. I kind of blew his phone up. Asked him just to text when he can because I’m worried about him.
I woke up this morning, and was told on instagram that he had read my messages 10 minutes ago, and didn’t reply. Stupidly I tried to call even after him not replying....went straight to voicemail...as opposed one ring and then to voilcemail (that occurs when blocked), so I know his phone is shut off. 
I can still message him on insta and other apps, but I have refrained from sending new ones. Obviously if he wanted to reply, he would have done so this morning after seeing them.
1. I hope he’s ok and 2. Wish I knew what I did wrong initially, and also why he read all my messages and immediately shut his phone off.",2

I don’t remember much but from what a friend of mine told me I fell like 8 times face flat onto the floor, and the girl that I love started asking why I took so many pills(she was fucking worried about me) and my dumbass told her to go fuck herself and took another xan then looked at her(mocking her) and took another one (5 now) at this point a friend of mine took my pills away or otherwise I would’ve been dead by now and to be honest that’s how I’d rather be if I’m not with her. She then texts me saying how things are gonna change between us(she was on her period so even worse) and I don’t even remember what I said, but I tried apologizing the day after(on Tuesday) but she told me that she still felt the same that she cares and appreciates me but not in that way anymore, I apologized yesterday too telling her that I was the one that fucked things up, I was the one that confused things again and that I was the one that acted like a fucking retard on Wednesday, she replied “Yeah it’s alright” “I love you fucking idiot” and tbh I couldn’t be more confused right now, I’m going to give her space because after all we’ve been through and all she’s said to me, I just can’t accept that she just changes with me again. On Tuesday when I see her I’m going to just stay away, I’m not gonna be a fucking dick and look at her the wrong way but I’m not gonna wait for her outside of the classroom like always(yes we’re in the same classes and that makes it worse) I’m posting this on here because I need advice, WHAT DO I FUCKING DOOO??If the vibe it’s all wrong next week and she actually doesn’t give a fuck about me, I’ll just off myself, not that she’ll miss me anyway.",2

The only real joy I get are the dopamine rushes from cocaine or when I make somebody else happy. 
Since I went off my meds, it feels like once something bad happens that’s out of my control I get this deep, sinking, heavy, hollow lump in my chest that stays the whole day and I can’t shake it off. 
And even if somebody helps me and I feel a little better, it stills lingers and then at best I feel numb. 
I can’t tell if since I went off my meds if I feel better or worse. I feel like my temperament is generally the same, but I feel things a little more and I can’t tell if that’s a good or bad thing. I definitely feel more like me—but again, I don’t know if that’s a good or a bad thing.

While the breadth of exercises and techniques employed in ACT is beyond the scope of this article, there is one exercise I’d like to share that has helped some of my clients see the inextricable link between valued living and painful experiences. In this activity (of which there are different variations), the therapist first asks the client to write on an index card some of the internal experiences they are struggling with most – difficult thoughts and judgments, emotions, memories.
I ask them, what do you notice when you read that index card? I feel awful, I don’t want this. What do you want to do with the card? I want to throw it in the trash. Then the client flips the card over, and I ask them to write out some of the things that are most important, most meaningful to them – being a parent, caring and supporting others, learning, growing, etc. What do you notice when you read this side? Warmth, it feels right, this is who I want to be. Where is the pain, where is the other stuff? Still here, on the other side of the card. What happens if you push that pain away, escape or avoid it? I push the meaningful stuff away too. In your heart of hearts, what does your experience tell you right now? If I’m going to do the things that are important to me, be the person that I want to be, I also have to make room for the painful stuff.",2

test_pid_2702,"Subvocalization, Visualization and Memory. : I was wondering if anyone else experiences trouble with memory and thinking. Hopefully, this post doesn't break any of the rules.
Whenever I try to explain this to people, they don't understand and look at me sideways. Ever since my depression reached a stage where it convinced my brain as suicide as a viable option, it's like the only thought that is ever produced. It's the final thought that has been created. For the past four years, I have had issues visualizing, which is a tremendous way, I think unless it's imagining a suicide. This make's it difficult to do schoolwork such as math as I can't trace the steps in my head. I can't subvocalize either, which is essentially thinking or talking to yourself in your head.
Below is a theory about why this is.
I had spoken to my psychology professor at college after learning about rumination in her class. I told her that I had a theory that the reason memory and thinking issues may have transpired from the depression was because of rumination. Rumination is when you focus on negative events and go over and over it in your head. So I thought my brain must have ""protected"" itself against this by shrinking my hippocampus, making it more difficult to recall these negative memories, but this also made it more difficult to recall all other memories as well. I had almost eidetic memory before this illness got me, and it frustrates me to hell that I'm unable to think the way I used to. She said that this was incorrect, though, which put me down a little bit because I thought I was coming closer to the root cause of my trigger for this illness.",2

-Was never a popular or fit guy
-Got better socially and physically but still had mental problems from growing up and still do
-Never had much hope finding a gf
-I feel everything in such a raw way that theres no filter
-Hard for me to connect with people in the first place, even harder to genuinely vibe with them
-Met a disney princess of a girl with eyes like gold
-Talked 1 to 2 months but felt like an eternity, like i knew her forever, never connected with someone like that in my life
-Went on 3 dates but feelings were overly intense already
-Everything was perfect
-Im pretty sure i was the one that messed up, can never know for sure
-Think she got scared because her last relationship ended badly
-Ended abrubtly
-Sent me into deep spiralling depression where i felt like i was dying, sobbing endlessly everyday, trying to get ""advice"" from every person i talked to or even never had before, just trying to get something that would make me feel any better or maybe it was just to vent
-Gained 50 pounds the next couple years
-Can still never think badly of her or stop blaming myself or stop ""opening the wound"" with thoughts of her
Its been years, i just dont know what to do at this point. Do you guys ever forget your first TRUE love, something  you feel like you might never have again just from how rare it was to happen in the first place? It was truly like seeing a unicorn, im not exagerating. Only thing thats kept me going is me trying to convince myself that ill be able to find someone like that again, no matter how many times i say it, i never fully believe myself although i want to. I also like to think that theres another dimension out there where it worked with me and her, that at least one of me is happy.
So thats where im at right now. Whenever i think of her i end up ruining my day and the next day at least, just opening up the wound and never having it fully heal. I know at least that i just wasnt ready to have a relationship with someone so good and i definitely, unfortunately, had to learn from it but i made sure of it i learned everything i could. Not gonna go through months of crying like a bitch for nothing.
I honestly dont know where im going with this, if anyone wants to relate and write there experiences, write any sort of advice, or just say ""same man, i feel you"", please do. I dont know what i need anymore, just that even knowing someone for little more than a month can manhandle you into shambled however hard or however long it chooses.
Thanks for reading, cheers.

NO HOT WOMEN LIKE ME
I'm miserable about how attractive women don't want me and I'm miserable that I'm broke and poor living with my father. I'm 26 never a girlfriend or kissed still a virgin. I'm fat ugly short and poor. I'm frustrated and miserable and stressed. Nobody loves me.
My best friend is about to become a pharmacist and his girlfriend is unreal hot and my other close friend has just gotten in with a very big firm and it's going to make a hundred grand a year and his girlfriend is ridiculous hot and I'm 26 and I'm just now halfway towards my bachelor's and I'm on academic probation so it feels like I've ruined my life already cuz I'm so far behind compared to everybody else.Hot girls don't date fat dudes who live with their dad. I also work for my dad as a salesman because I don't want to push carts at a grocery store. And attractive women don't date cart pushers. 
Where I grew up in Colorado all the girls thought I was a loser and when I hung out with my friends my friends girlfriends think I'm a loser and it is because I'm ugly looking and fat.
 I now live in Massachusetts and I'm practically invisible to good looking women and I also don't have any friends here and I've lived here for 7 years I only have friends because I keep tabs and visit my once in Colorado.
26M Never a girlfriend or kissed still a virgin never a date I'm fat ugly short and poor. No decent women (20sF) like me. Nobody cares that I am miserable and no one wants to help me and no one cares about me. Can I get advice? 
**RIA CIUFFO. ALEXANDRA COOPER. SOFIA FRANKLYN. KAYCE SMITH.**
Every woman on the show Letterkenny. 
 i want to attract women at that level but everyone tells me ""never gonna happen"" so FUCK. MY. LIFE
here's a list of every woman who treated me badly or who rejected me and friend zoned me now you know how bad I've got it
ASHLEY:
Girl i can't get over got married and she's in love with him and it depresses me beyond comprehension that she loves him and she will never love me. I'm absolutely fucking depressed.
i fucking hate him he ruined my life. I asked girls online if he's better looking than me and they all said yes he was and theyd rather date him than me. Can anybody give me advice thats beneficial for me? if you say ""If you really love her youd be happy for her"" or ""move on"", that has no benefits for me it only benefits her POS husband.
I don't get a bright side or a silver lining or happy ending just fucked over.
I TOLD HER MY FEELINGS SHE REJECTED ME AND SHE TRIED SETTING ME UP WITH A FAT UGLY GIRL AFTER REJECTING ME. F**K MY LIFE. I HAVE THE WORST LIFE POSSIBLE
ALEX:
My prom date who I had a crush on for years made out with another dude in front of me and ran off to F**k him in his car and because she was from out of town she stayed over my place and the next morning after she invited him over so she can make out with him and in his car on my driveway amd people found out and I got humiliated all the way to graduation
SARA: 
The girl i had feelings for in high school but who friendzoned me is getting married  to a guy who is cheated on her with a teacher She started dating him when me and her were seniors and he was a freshman. Hes an absolute scumbag. I truly hate him. He was caught sexting a teacher caught on the news and has been caught texting other girls with intent to cheat multiple times. and now the girl I want is marrying him and **A TEACHER HERSELF**
She would use me as the shoulder to cry on and then when she was done crying to me she would have me go away and then she would go back to him after I'm not saying it wasn't my own fault but to some degree I was used emotionally
and now everybody is happy that they're getting married it's like I'm living in the Twilight Zone that people forget that he cheated on her with the teacher and got caught on the news. 
Then five years ago when my mom passed away everybody I knew gave me their condolences even people I didn't like but they still were decent enough to tell me their condolences **EXCEPT HER** She didn't even give me a my condolences at the minimum despite her feeding me lies saying how me and her were such close good friends.  She couldn't even text me ""My condolences"" or ""Sorry for your loss"" not even 2 to 4 words in a text. I go to therapy **BECAUSE** of this experience. 
I then messaged her saying how it hurt me that she didn't say anything I told her how I felt about her I told her that her boyfriend now fiance is a scumbag I told her she's dumb for staying with a scumbag like that and the last thing she ever told me was
""F**k you loser sorry you're so mad at the world"" 
**THE WEEK MY MOM DIED!!!**
 last thing I ever said to her was ""how is that possible? I'm not a scumbag who cheats on you. Isn't that what you prefer to f**k?"" That was five years ago and we haven't spoken since. The wedding was in July
All my life women I've liked rejected me or ignored me. The only time women liked me they were morbidly obese and extremely unattractive but then I would be told to ""give them a chance that's your league anyways at least they're nice girls"" 😒 being told to take an L with a smile isn't a great life. Especially if you compare her to the women who rejected me. Their husbands and boyfriends (WHO I LOATHE) see that I'm with a woman much less unattractive after being rejected by them gives them a whole lot of leverage over me and that's absolutely humiliating for me like ""Haha my girl rejected you and you're stuck with an ugly woman. sucks to suck loser"". That is HUMILIATION defined, and everybody wants me to embrace this happening and it's NOT FAIR.
I'll be happy when a woman hotter than the women who rejected me loves me. Until then, ALL I EVER GOT WAS FUCKED OVER NO LUBE OR SPIT AND THEN PEOPLE TELL ME BE HAPPY FOR THE PEOPLE I HATE. TO JUST LIE DOWN AND TAKE IT AND THATS FUCKING BULLSHIT",2

I've gotten so used to the fact that if I feel bad that when he's not, I feel bad when he isn't around. I HATE this, since even though he though he gives me more help than anyone else, when he isn't able to, depression begins to attack more. Clearly this isn't good, and maybe this isn't even what's going on. This is just what I thought, and I wasn't sure what to do. I love him so much, but I need what's best for me. I don't want to hurt him and saying to him ""oh by the way i've become so attached to you that when you aren't around i feel more depressed than usual"". I feel like cutting him out is what's good for me now, but later (once I've had time to myself to pick myself up again), what would he think? I couldn't just go back to him after that. He'd either be too hurt by me or too scared to hurt me again. I don't know what to do.

In the past week, tired of being so stagnant I’ve tried to make a change. I stopped drinking as much, eating less and healthier (doing keto) and applying for jobs. 
I have an interview today in about a hour for a manager at a pizza place. I’ve known for about a week so I ordered some nice clothes off amazon. The first time they delivered it to an apartment across my complex with the same building number, I went over there and asked if she had my package, showing her the delivery image of my package on her patio furniture. She didn’t speak English and kept saying “no no no” so I just left. That was yesterday. I called amazon and asked for a refund and got my $60 back, replacing my order with in depth instructions on how to find me.
I was able to select overnight shipping by 8am and thought “perfect my interviews at 9:30, I can still be there early!”. Nope. I wake up and check amazon and it says “delivery failed/attempted” so my interview clothes will arrive tomorrow. I canceled the delivery. I guess I’ll go in my poorly fitting joggers and polo shirt.
I feel like no matter how much I try awful things happen. I was really looking forward to getting this job and wanted to put my best effort into getting it.

I’m a service member stationed in the Middle East (the nicer part). I was out with my friends one night and we decided to hit the club because it was a friday night and why not? (This is a part of the Middle East that allows drinking at Hotels and certain Clubs). We’re having a great night, music bumping, buying shots, telling stories, the whole works. I’m feeling pretty tipsy and I have to use the restroom...This is where my night takes a turn for the worst. As I am using the urinal (it’s a pretty compact restroom) another man bigger than myself shoves me into the stall next to the urinal and begins taking advantage of me. He attempts to rip my pants off as he’s taking off his own...I can barely register what’s going on until the adrenaline kicks in. My pants are at my ankles, then I slam his head into the wall. He falls, I pick my pants up. The anger explodes and I stomp him until I run out of breath. I run to my friends and say we have to leave . They question it, I tell them to trust me. I break down on the way back to base. I never told them what happened. I feel ashamed, embarrassed, weak. This isn’t my first or worst time being sexually assaulted but a wave of horrible memories of when I was a kid flooded back. This was months ago. Seeing a military psychiatrist about it, she says she doesn’t know how I am able to keep a level head. I try my best but I definitely have my days...I don’t know why I posted here but I needed to put my mind to something...Thank you for reading if you did.

I just hope that I can actually get some sales going on just the one t shirt long enough to make some money to buy the stuff I need so I can actually buy stuff to make more shirts with different mental illness designs on them.  so far I can only afford to do just the one and kinda feeling like now it might suck. but have no one to talk too about it for thoughts, opinions because I am afraid that if it is a good idea they would steal my idea and make a business off of it and then I am out of the business that I want to start towards this.",2

Why I should be dead
- What the actual fuck is the point, all we do is eat shit and sleep with the occasional laugh
- I'm never going to achieve something because I just don't give a shit about it
- I've never found a friend that I can share feelings with without them trying to change the subject or I know that they'll react worse than I want them to
- I waste everyone's time and fuck up a lot
- People often see me as someone who is less capable of things just because I have autism and am ""different"" whatever the fuck that is supposed to mean so they treat me like a retard even though I can take care of myself
- I have no humour at all, I can only tell self deprecating jokes because that's all I know
- True love doesn't exist, it's a complicated way of saying I want to fuck someone so I can have children and my genes can pass on
- Death would free me from everything

Since he knew me better than anyone else, my girl and he became good friends. they used to talk about me alot. I mean like seriously, she used to ask him everything. and my friend was helping her in every decision where he should get involved. I mean there are some boundaries, right ?
One day i was alone with my girlfriend and her phone was right in front of me. she went to the kitchen and i took her phone and used it for some time. also read the message between my friend and girlfriend. We had our first fight.
I was so mad and i had every right to be ! My friend was literally aware of the personal things between me and my girlfriend. he should have told me, after then i was having some trust issues.

I'm 30 years old, just turned on the 12th of February with no celebration to speak of or any friends to hang out with. I don't drive because of no license, I have no real education outside of my GED, and no training or skills I can practically use in a job setting besides typing really fast. I live with my mom in a brand new state that I'm completely miserable in with ZERO FRIENDS. I'm also 35,000$ in debt because my mom opened up several credit cards in my name to pay for bill's without my knowing for years. To top all that off, I haven't had sex in 3 years nor had any sort of physical intimacy with a woman in that time. So yeah, I'm rock fucking bottom. 
Yet even with all of this, I still cling furiously to the future that I want to forge for myself. I want all the wasted years doing nothing, sadness, crippling anxiety and loneliness to all have meant something. I can sit here and blame my mother for all the years she abused me and broke my down into nothing or never pushing me... or I can blame myself and the fact I was depressed or that I got too comfortable in my sadness and never left. Regardless, you can't fucking change yesterday. So sitting down and thinking about what's to blame is absolutely pointless.
 I want to achieve happiness and gain love because god damnit do I deserve it. I want what's mine with my own two hands. Nothing will stop me from getting there, not even myself because boy can I be my own worst enemy. Its about time I change that and become my own bestfriend. Its about time I fucking finally change my stars and find my true north. 
If you're anything like me just know that you aren't alone in your struggles. May you find the strength and motivation in yourself to move forward. It took me long enough to finally wake the fuck up but here I am. I'm going to be going to college soon to become a Certified Medical Assistant while working shitty minimum wage jobs and from there, I'll save up and one day become a Registered Nurse.

test_pid_2762,"some answers : So i was reading this book called ""Breaking the cycle"" for my chronic porn addiction and one thing that stuck with me which the author said was that your tendancy to be alone is probably coming from trauma. One's tendancy to isolate him/herself is a subconcious decision of the brain to protect the being when you consider everyone a threat. I am definitely not saying that we all are victims of the world. just maybe some of us are straight up narcissists who aren't ready to negotiate a little bit to hold a relationship and want to be treated like a princess all the time.
The thing is most probably your condition is just unfortunate, your father left you, your sister molested you and you couldn't seek help, got bullied everyday,your bother was considered better than you, have a mental illness, your best friend betrayed you, you're not capable of excelling at something or whatever it is.
The reason i say unfortunate is because nothing was actually meant to happen to you, you just happened to be the one it happened to.You could come out of it but there is no guarantee or magic formula that could solve your condition. Maybe if you control your every conscious decision to make your life better you could come out of it but some battle scars would still be left.
I was trying to find all the answers but trust me there are none. It is what it is. Constant rejection and betrayal in every field of life has made me totally numb which is worse than feeling depressed. I eat alone I stay alone the friends i had have taken a step ahead in their lives so it's just me now and it's not like i didn't try. I tried hard. very hard. but i understand survivorship bias and it's not meant for everybody and again it's just unfortunate. I am writing this on a saturday night and i am a little drunk, just got rejected idk like the 100th time called my friends up got the final vibe that i am not a part of their lives, failed miserably in an exam that i studied for. and my ocd has gotten worse. I am very afraid for tomorrow and the days to come if i will be able to stay with myself anymore.

I'm scared to confront her about this because whenever I do something she doesn't like she says I'm ruining our relationship and that I just don't know anything. She refuses to take responsibility for anything and won't talk to me when I need her to. She refuses to believe that anything she does can have a negative affect on me even though she always clutches her pearls whenever I say something she doesn't like even a little bit. She likes to believe she does more to help me than I do. The truth is she has no idea what I'm going through and probably thinks I'm just faking it at this point. She denies any logic or reasoning I use to come to my conclusions just because she thinks something different and has no way of proving it. Whenever I ask her to explain why what I'm saying is false and what she's saying is true she just gets super mad and says stuff like ""we're not in a court of law"" or ""this isn't a debate competition"" She refuses to acknowledge that basic logic and reasoning is required to make any claim or deny any of mine.

One day she dumped me out of the blue without saying any clear reason for the breakup and she gave false hope so i didn't know she was out of love.
I don't want to make it too long for you guys and talk about her behavior during the breakup which was totally wrong ( she didn't want me to move on and she lied alot ) unfortunately i did the mistake of my life by begging and pleading for two weeks and she said we got back to the relationship.
I was out of the country for 2 months and she was lying and she was with me due to empathy ( found out later by her ) she made me look like a freak to her friends by not answering my phones while she was with them and calls me when she was alone + trying to make me look like i doubt her and alot of other things and her behavior was totally wrong .
Last time we talked she told me im a weak man and if i didn't beg things might been different , she also said she is much stronger than me and i should found a weak girl otherwise i would get dumped again and none of her friends blamed her for dumping me because of my behavior after the break up.
I know i made the worst thing a man could do and im 26 years old and i should have been more mature but i can't do anything about it now .. we both are dentist and we are doing researches and experience year at the same college . no one respects me anymore and i have been stressed all of the time and im doing my job while im stressed and the quality is really bad .
I was not weak with her during the relationship and never allowed her to mistreat me during the relationship ...i lost it all after 20 days of the breakup when i saw her enjoying life and she doesn't care about me or the relationship.
I feel like i lost everything, we had mutual friends and they don't even look at me anymore , heard people saying this is the weak man , c**t  and no one respects me anymore , i feel like i would be in this shame for the rest of my life and everyone thinks im weak and pathetic i turned into a (joke ).
Im new to this school , and know no one their except her and her friends, she has a new bf in the same school as well and even my behavior is totally wrong know because of the stress.
Tl;dr : turned from a confident successful man to a weak rejected man that no one respects because of my weakness during the breakup, i did take a vacation for 10 days from college to take a break and im thinking of quitting ( i know weak move ) but honestly im in a place that no one respects or like me .

test_pid_2775,"Why am I feeling stress and disgust instead of sympathy? : I'm a univercity student that studies IT. I'm 21, but still living with my parents. (it's rather common in my country, as I think). We try to help each other at home.
My mother is a nice, hard working, but VERY emotional person. She hates when other people are speaking in a loud voice. Hates when people argue with her. It's very easy to make her hysterical. When she shouts or just speaks in a violent/sarcastic manner I feel very, very stressful. 
For example, today she came home after a hard day at work and found an oil spot on her linen pajamas (me and granny were cooking pancakes). She went into a scandal mode and ended up crying. She now sits and says that nobody likes her or cares about her. It's some kind of play called ""I will do all by myself because nobody cares about me"" and she acts like this alomst every time when she's angry on us. Of course, that's not true, because we care, but when she's in such a mood trying to calm her down or just touching her is dangerous -- she will likely insult you and would make you feel even more angry. 
I think that's why I started to avoid her in any ways possible when she suddenly changes her mood. I can feel by the way she closes the door or how she's cooking how she feels, and when something's wrong, fear mixed with disgust overflows me and I try to hide inside my room. I know that avoiding her is horrible -- she's always working hard in a toxic collective and needs an emotional support. But I cannot give her that support -- because even in case of minor mistake she will become angry and winll make herself and all the people around her to hate each other. 
I don't know what i'm asking about -- how to comfort her or how to deal with psychological pressure. Probably both. So...
1) How to make her feel more comfortable without face-to-face contact?
2) How to calm down after seeing all of that?

And my dad constantly has this tone in his voice and the way he acts towards me suggests that I think of myself as some sort of hero or victim in my story and that I need to just grow up and just act like nothings happening. This couldn't be further from the truth because I am 100% aware that despite the fact I can't control it, I am still responsible for anything I do in this state and just because I have serious depression doesn't mean it's not my fault I dropped out of school, and hobbies, or how I ghosted all my friends, I know that I'm still a stubborn piece of sh*t and that despite hating myself more than anything I manage to still have a huge ego. But what I want him to know is that it works the other way around too, just because I'm responsible for these doesn't mean that I'm in control or that I have the physical capability of just changing in the snap of a finger, I want him to know that my 100% isn't the same as his 100% and that he shouldn't expect me to live up to these expectations just because he managed to.",2

test_pid_2797,"I just want a hug : My boyfriend recently broke up with me, and it’s a bit hard trying to find someone else (I’m bi but the only people who want to date me are creepy guys). I’m starting to fall back into that pit of desperation that I was in before me and my ex were dating.
I’ve tried to hug people because I miss it so much and I just want human contact, but it’s never enough. I don’t want to touch my mom at all. One of my friends hugged me last week and it felt euphoric, but it only lasted less than five seconds before she kind of brushed me off and ran to her bus. I felt really sad for a while after that. Another friend asked for a hug yesterday, I’m guessing he needed the comfort because his dog is going to be put down today. I was expecting a long hug, but it was very brief. It lasted maybe a second or two before he turned to my other friend and hugged her for almost thirty seconds.
Then, as I was talking to one of my other friends, she was complaining about how she can never find anyone to date who wants to date her for longer than a week. She’s 18 but usually develops crushes on people who are not able to date her (she had a crush on a 13-year-old and almost four 15/16-year-olds). She was ranting about her best friend and how she loves cuddling with her, and I just remember feeling really lonely. Here she was complaining about how alone she was, meanwhile she has 3 best friends she can turn to when she wants to cuddle. And here I am, too awkward to ask for a long hug but desperately needing one. I don’t want things to go back to how they used to be, but it feels like they will
TL;DR: I’ve been lonely since my breakup and I feel frustrated because whenever anyone hugs me (which is not very often), it’s very brief and leaves me even lonelier.",2

test_pid_2800,"Anxiety and depression are not part of you, Emotional freedom is. : Emotions like anxiety and depression are just happenings within the space of awareness that you are
These sensations cannot define you, your true nature includes and goes way beyond this sensations
We should not blame ourselves to feel anxiety or depression, the more we realize that every sensation is meant to be felt the more at ease we’ll be able to be while experiencing them
Judging ourselves and try to change from a place of control and force won’t work, true change can be realized only from a space of pure acceptance.
So instead of blaming yourself and entering into a negative spiral allow to simply accept those sensations by being close to them
The more you’ll accept the inner pain the faster you’ll realize that it was all an illusion and from there it will be clear to you that emotional freedom is all that there is and that will always be.

I just don’t know what to do anymore.  
I am 38yo and I’m finding it harder and harder as life goes on, I seem to be failing at everything that I do. Work, relationships. Friendships. Cooking, everything. I secretly suffer with social anxiety and find it very hard meeting friends and building relationships that last. I find it hard making conversation and get in my head about what to talk about and can’t relax into any conversation. I feel that I don’t know enough about the world or popular subjects and therefore am uncomfortable adding value to any conversation so avoid as much as possible and I even struggle with small talk. Truth be told I don’t think I have anything in common with most. I can never remember anything and since a child have never retained information easy I can watch a film or read a book and then be asked what it was about and have no idea atall.
I am a workaholic and love keeping busy but people are not into it as much as me and put me down to the point where I second guess myself all the time. Am I doing to much am I doing this right, why does none get this or is it me. I’m made to feel like I’m not wanted in any environment that I work in because other people don’t want to put in as much as I do and I even have people causing issues for me and because I can’t communicate properly it always comes back to bite me on the arse. I currently have gone into a team off people that have since before I started taken a dislike to me and every time I’m in I’m being told that I’m doing this wrong I’m doing that wrong when I know it’s right but it’s because they don’t want to do it.
My relationship has been for 9 years but feels more like convenience than a relationship as we are not close and we know that we cannot afford to live if we are not together so is more of a housemate situation with occasional sex. I cannot cook to save my life and I ruin every meal and dispute trying my hardiest to improve just cannot get it right and I’m made to feel like I’m usless at every attempt.

test_pid_2803,"I have no interesting title : In 5 years, I did not get into a med school, my BF broke up with me, 3 of my cats died, I live with my parents. I am a university drop out and I used to be the straight A student. My family changed its behaviour towards me when I did not get into the med. I do not speak with my best friend, who I also love. Basically, I have no friends, future or anything. The only thing that keeps me from a suicide are my cats and the fact that I save stray cats. I tried to get into therapy sessions but all the psychologists either did not respond or rejected me due to overflow of patients. I tried learning Swedish. I am currently in English classes and I consider quitting. I am trying martial arts. Already tried yoga classes, ballet, gym... Everything. Nothing works for me.
I miss my friend. We used to talk and have a good time. We used to go on trips. Now I just see him online and he does not write me. I am tired of all of this. It breaks my heart when I think of him being with someone else.
Everytime I tell him about my problems he tells me to go find a psychologist or do something with myself. When I tell him that I am sorry that he feels that way (when he tells me his feelings) - he flips and tells me that I am dismissive over his feelings... He tells me I am childish... He does not want to communicate the problem further because I am hard to communicate with.
I am unable to learn because I instantly forget everything or do not remember it the next day. I used to be this beast able to learn anything anytime. I even started to bite my nails again, have nightmares and so on. Training does nothing to me, as if I was unable to feel the oxytocine.

test_pid_2808,"To be so emotionally damaged your brain no longer processes it : I apologize if thisi s the wrong sub for this - if there is one that it would fit better on, please say something, but I want to know what mental traits (I don't want to call them illnesses or disorders) cause a person to be completely unable to process mental or emotional trauma.
For example, I'm writing a story, and my character has a flaw where she undergoes something mentally or emotionally stressful, and any time she experiences feelings of guilt, remorse, or shame, she feels a mass of....something building up in her chest, and where as a normal person might have a very emotional reaction such as crying, screaming in anger at someone, giving a tearful apology, something very emotional, very dramatic, she just...doesn't. Her brain immediately disengages and puts her on autopilot, and she will remove herself from the situation quickly yet calmly, then go into the next room (or, if possible, her bedroom) and start doing some mundane task and thinking about the task, not about the emotionally harrowing event that happened five minutes prior. Her brain just acts as if it didn't happen.
To give an example, let's say you found out your mother was very badly injured in a car accident (and you have an amazing relationship with your mother, just wanted to say this because the last time I tried to use this example, people were like ""well i hate my mother so i'd celebrate lmfaooooo"") and right when you're about to cry or scream or freak out or have a meltdown, you just...leave the room. And as you're leaving the room, you remember you have clothes in the drye, so you autopilot into the laundry room and take the clothes out, start folding them, then go put them away, and your brain doesn't process anything about if your mother is okay, almost as if you never found out about the car accident.
My question is, what mental trait(s) cause this in a person? If there is an actual mental illness or disorder that covers it, what is it called? Anyone who can relate, can you (if it's not too triggering, of course) share a time when you had a similar disconnect and what you felt when/if your brain finally processed the information, for better or for worse?",2

test_pid_2810,"I'm not okay : So I've not been doing good lately. I've not been doing good since Valentine's day. To explain a little I've to back up. I've been trying to get approved for Weight Loss Surgery since last year, its taken 8 months to get all approvals, \*sleep doctor fucked me up, she never scheduled the sleep test and by the time it was 1.scheduled, 2. the test was done and 3. the results were in, it had taken 3 months. It was supposed to happen August 2019, it didn't happen till October so I didn't get my Cpap until Nov.13th and it takes 3wks for approval. They pushed me back 2 months (due to work and because tbh they suck) even though everything was clear. I did not get my surgery date until about a month ago. That's when things started to get worse.   
I had to go on a liquid diet which is hard mentally and physically. And I was doing it all alone. my father told me he was going to do a partial liquid diet with me only drinking them at night so I didn't have to be around fast food/junk food and when he was cooking stuff I can't touch. That didn't happen. So I had to deal with his shit for 2wks. Then surgery day came.   
I was alone. You see when you go in for surgery you can have someone wait for you, \*and all your shit if you brought anything for afterward\* and then come see you either in recovery or in your private room. Dad decided not to do any of it. He decided work was more important and got mad at me because clearly I was upset and was not going to beg him to stay. Well, I get thru surgery, no complications, I feel like shit which is expected. I got to my room, I text people and whatnot. And well. My friend tried to visit but she got sick so naturally, she can't come into a hospital into a medical ward that has people who just had surgery.  That's just completely not possible. So by the time she felt better she had work. \*side note I was in the hospital about 3.5 days. so Friday to Monday. this is important\*   
I had no on visit me I wasn't expecting anyone to show up the day of surgery because I was asleep on and off till 8 pm \*surgery was at 10 am\*. But Saturday came and I figured okay my friend can't come but Dad surely will visit his only KNOWN child in the hospital right?... Right? Nope. I saw no one except nurses/doctors etc no one visited \*none of my other friends drive, and the hospital is a drive for most people\* okay fine surely he'll come Sunday, he won't just NOT visit his daughter after her first major surgery as an adult right? \*I live with him, just to be clear\* He didn't visit. At all. I got a few ""nice"" texts that is it. He didn't tell me why he didn't visit or give excuses until the next day when he decided I wasn't more important than work yet again. I was discharged by 1 pm he didn't get me until 9 pm. \*apparently no one would cover his part of the job, and he wouldn't just be straight up and say I need to go get my daughter from the hospital I'll be back.\* all I needed was maybe 2hrs of his time. To get me home and then he could go to work again. Nope. His ""excuses"" as to why he didn't visit was that he couldn't leave the bathroom all weekend, which means he didn't take his meds correctly which he does often and couldn't leave because he was constantly using the bathroom. \*note I had a private bathroom he could use as needed. \* That was his excuse, there were rest-stops on the way, there was ways to get to the hospital. He decided that I was not worth enough to do so.   
That started the depressive episode, and it is still getting worse daily. After surgery, I was unable to go to therapy for at least a week, because healing, then it turned into ""I am demanding you make both of our appointments because I don't want to do it"". we see different therapists, he's going bi-weekly I go weekly they rarely have the same days. I had struggled to get to the office via phone, and when I did I said fuck this I'll make my own he's a grown man he can do his own. I can't see my therapist until the 9th. It will be nearly a month since I last saw her. And each day makes it worse. I finally got thru the 2nd portion of the liquid diet, now I'm on pureed, and its still so hard. Because I am the one trying to go by the book on what I can safely eat. Is it on the pureed allowed food list? no? then no you can't eat it. ""yes? okay good how to make it taste good without adding extra shit. And I'm still doing it alone, Dad swore he'd support me and help me, and what does he do? Bring more and more fast food in, junk food and ice cream I cannot touch \* I can have sugar free popsicles. That's about it, same with sugar-free jello/pudding\* but he brings in things like mega fries, or wings, or Chinese, stuff I LOVE but I cannot touch now, and maybe ever. Or he cooks a huge batch of chili/taco meat and again, its to ""solid"" for me, that's soft food stage, I got 2wks before that's allowed. He's been told, he just doesn't care.   
So each day it's making harder to keep to the diet. I try to ask for help and I'm shot down, I get told ""no that's not allowed"" but it is in the book I was given on the stage given! I am trying so hard to keep to the diet, to ignore my cravings while actually still eating. I get sick if I don't eat, if I eat, I get sick. I can't drink anything for an hour after I eat. And I can't seem to get any support, from anyone except a few friends. And that hurts. I've been pushing my self harder than I should because if I wait for dad, I'd never get to the store and then I'm rushed because he wants to leave. I can't do that when I need to LOOK AT STUFF and check labels. This surgery isn't a quick fix, I'm a little over 2wks post-op and I'm struggling. And I feel so alone. I see the scale going down, and it barely makes me happy. I have started not to feel anything. And that scares me, I'm falling into old habits which isn't good, \*thankfully not food-related\* but that's backtracking into a person I don't want to be. I still feel guilty for buying NEEDED items, stuff like panties I feel guilty about.   
I feel so fucking alone and I can't dump this on my friends, it is not fair to them, it is not fair that I have to feel this way and that my only living parent sucks so badly. I can't do anything, I'm terrified to go out, I couldn't even push myself to get into the shower and wash my hair and deknot it! \*and its sad-looking limp, lifeless and full of knots and tangles, and my hair is thin so it's bad\* I want to have a life again, this surgery was supposed to help me do more, my weight was stopping me from doing so much and I need to do more for once. and I can't bring myself to do it. I have to really wait until 8wks are up so I'm fully healed from everything and I can go to the gym, and get back to work and do more. But I'm not able to right now. Right now in a sense, I'm chained to the house, driving takes to much out of me, going to the store tires me out. I just wanna be happy. and I know therapy will help because I got the news I can move after 8wks \*I cannot afford it, I'm living off my tax refund right now it's that bad\* but it's so hard to be happy anymore...Because limited to nothing makes me happy anymore....  
I just feel so damn alone anymore and I don't know what to do.",2
test_pid_2811,"I might be a different person if it wasn't for my dad : I was 3 when my dad left. I didn't know him. And like most kids I blamed myself. By the time I was five I had already experienced trauma. And by 5th grade my mother believed I had severe shyness but my psychiatrist said it was social anxiety. I waited years and years for my dad to come back into my life. All I got was excuses in phone calls. Him blaming my mom for why he wasn't around. Then my brother was diagnosed autistic and I became like the other parent looking out for him. I grew up fast. And had few friends. I got bullied alot. The stress grew on me. By 12 I had a stomach ulcer I woke up at 5 am with the worst stomach ache the lights were dim in the bathroom and I was in the tub and puked over the edge and my mom woke and noticed a large puddle of blood..  We rushed to the er. Where I kept getting sick. My stress hasn't ever really been the best and I never really blamed anyone. It wasn't my mom's fault my dad wasn't a better person and my mom needed all the help she could get. By 15 the bullying caught up and I had my first suicide attempt. And it spread in school. I was that weird girl no one talked to but looked down upon.  My teachers grew worried and wanted to include me somehow. The problem was the club they got me in I couldn't stay in cause things were hard at home and my brother who was 2 years younger was having a hard time. Highschool was agonizingly slow. I graduated.

From a dream career to creating a family of their own, there’s something that gives them an enthusiasm for “getting the chance” to exist. Meanwhile, even in my best times, I struggle to see what the big deal is. Even if I can come to enjoy my time on this earth, if someone were to ask me if I’d rather have not been born, I would say yes without a doubt because there simply isn’t a point. I refuse to tell many people this because they would look at me like I’m an alien. 
I wouldn’t even call myself depressed right now, considering the episodes I’ve had in the past. I’d say currently, I’m only logically depressed. What I mean by that is while I’m still thinking the same thoughts I did when I was actually depressed, they’re not hitting me emotionally in the same way they would in a vulnerable state.

Luckily I made it out to my car so nobody saw me but I’m still so embarrassed. I’m 23 years old and I can’t figure out how to function well enough to ACTUALLY FUNCTION. I didn’t realize it immediately, but I haven’t been eating or sleeping for the last 3 or so days. A few snacks here and there, a couple hours scattered, but nothing substantial. 
I don’t know how I forgot? Like it’s basic human instincts? I haven’t felt hungry. I’ve been tired but I’m always tired. I should have learned this stuff already. I’m a grown adult. I’m annoyed with myself. 
The lady I sit next to is incredibly nice and she noticed. She texted to check on me and when I finally felt better enough to go back in, she asked if I was ok and checked on me again. She’s so sweet and I’m really thankful to know her but now I’m paranoid. She’s going to thank less of me. I’ve been teetering on the edge of “good enough” to play with this group and I don’t want to lose my spot because I seem “weak or unstable or frail”.  I work hard to keep my spot and I truly enjoy being there. I’ve learned so much and I’ve had so many great experiences playing with this group. I really don’t want to lose that. 
I know everyone makes mistakes but this was such a stupid one. 
Anyway, thanks for listening. To the rest of the depressed folks here; take care of yourself. Even when it’s hard. Even when you’re stressed and tired and it feels like you’re not in control, just do your best. Do the bare minimum. It doesn’t have to be perfect. Do what you can. Take care. &lt;3",2

test_pid_2834,"Coping with job loss : Hi all, 
Recently was let go from a job a few weeks back. This was extremely sudden and unexpected. I hadn’t been happy there but was a good worker who put my all into my work. I took a trip and filed for unemployment and I also have a part time that’s keeping me afloat. Recently so thought everything was in place but I received a letter today for a re-evaluation for unemployment which sent me into a spiral. I absolutely can’t make ends meet without it and although my job stated in writing they wouldn’t contest unemployment due to the circumstances I’m terrified.
I’ve found myself becoming depressed and listless. I’ve had certain pockets before or crisis times but they all seem to alleviate with some hard work and exercise. However I’m finding myself drowning suddenly in anxiety and panic. I’ve had anxiety attacks return suddenly, i can’t seem to sleep and yet i have no motivation to get out of bed. It’s been a struggle the last few mornings to really push myself to do anything. I get sudden shocks of listlessness and I feel totally disconnected.
I have been sitting interviews and submitting applications like crazy but each “we’ve decided to go in a different direction” stings. I’ve thought about embracing my hobby which is travel and maybe starting a travel blog but when i get on the computer etc i just sit there and lose track. I’ve never had an episode hit me this hard before.
I very recently got into a relationship with a supportive boyfriend but it’s really making me withdraw from him. I feel bad and guilty that he has to deal with this so new into our relationships. My friends also have kinda seemed to just moved on after me telling them. I find myself drinking a lot more than I used to secretly and this is also scaring me. My benefits just ran out so i have no access to healthcare or anything until Medicaid comes through. I absolutely don’t know what to do.

test_pid_2844,"The reason I stopped drinking. A story. : It's about to be march. Last year I moved because the stress of where I was living. Got to the point where my self-destructive nature flared up. Almost a year at my new local. In this last move I lost all but one person in my support network. I try and respect the fact that he has a life outside of my problems. Don't get me wrong we watch eachothers back. He is doing great for himself. I try not to drag him down with me.
I properly interact with, maybe 6-8 people outside of family. When it comes up in conversation. People ask me, ""Why don't you drink? Bad experience, or what?"" I keep my depression hidden from everyone including my family. My mom doesn't know. My sister has an idea but not how bad it really is. I don't even talk about it to my dad. He is super old-fashioned, really religious.
I made the mistake of drinking today. Two beers that's all it took. Everything came flooding back to me. It felt like I was an addict on relapse. I tried occupying myself with cleaning. My go to for the past three years. Didn't stop it. Here I am on Reddit again...
It's like a sick game of having to relive the worst moments of your live, there is no pause button. I don't have the funds for a therapist I move around too much to actually have one anyway. Between the depression, stress and concussions my memory is absolutely terrible. Sometimes I wake up and have no idea where I am. Other times I have to force myself to get out of bed. 
It wasn't as bad as it is now. I used to talk to my grandmother. She was my stone. The only person that truly listened to what I had to say. Even if it was stupid stuff. She passed away April 2016. I can't recall the last conversation we had. I don't remember her voice or the way she used to look. I had to carry her ashes from California to Nebraska. After it was all said and done I was disowned. A year later I found out. The reason I was in foster care at 3yo.
This is what haunts me. This is what lurks in the shadowy recesses of my mind.
 I was born in Texas. My mother and father had 'forbidden love' my dad's side of the family didn't like my mom because she was a white girl. So they left Texas when I was one. My mom's family didn't like my dad because he was Hispanic regardless of legality. They 86'ed my dad because they ran the sheriff's office.
A few years later they reported my mom to child protective services. At 2-3yo I was in foster care. A crowded one in Wyoming. My sister and I slept on the floor. I gave half my food to her because she was always hungry. My mother won the case. But, if she didn't. Her family would have adopted my sister and left me in the system.
All my life I had taken back seat to my sister. I have never once been upset with her over it. She was allowed to do just about anything. I was hidden away as if I was some disfigured runt. My mother has a thing for racist guys, they fit in real well with the rest of her family.
I took it upon myself at a young age to help, support, and protect my elder sister. I have been through hell and back. I have been making her look good by comparison for so long. That when I start to do good for myself. My mother and her s.o. are shocked that I could even do whatever. It put a lot of strain on our sibling relationship.
I have a few nice scars, reminders of what I have done to myself in the past. I attempted suicide a few times. I have one scar that goes around my whole body. That was the last attempt. Back in idk 2014-2015. I have to see it every time I look in the mirror. After that attempt I was under surveillance. By my support network. After three personal attempts and multiple attempts by other people (I would kick the hornet's nest) I can now say I am hard to kill. My dad says ""it's because God has a plan for you yet."" But, I stopped believing in God in foster care.
Idk, I feel like my entire existence is perverse. Like I don't belong in this reality. As if by some crazy fluke here I am. The crazy thing is, is that I have always felt that way. Most days I can just shrug it off and keep myself busy. But when I drink it comes with a vengeance.
Having typed all this out, I do feel marginally better. Or at least well enough to go about my day. Without being the 20something (y.o.) dude at the verge of tears because two beers brought back every bad memory of a sub-par life.",2

Ok so, i’ve been in the same school since kindergarten, i’ve been bullied because i used to walk alone and because i used to play with girls, the same bullies stayed in the same school for 15 years, i tried becoming friends with them but they’re just toxic and they really hurted me, no one tried to become friends with me except for some girls, but then they would just leave me for another friend, i thought it was my fault and i still think it’s my fault, i open up to people pretty quick and then i like to be my true self...
So i met this girl in grade 2 and she was pretty awesome i like her and we’re still friends til today, now i’m in a group of friends (and she’s in it) the group was made in school, it was first made of 6 people without me, they had a social media group and they kept making plans without me even tho i was always around them, last year i was finally added to the group and i was finally invited to parties etc, i was happy but there’s this guy in the group and he used to bully me when he started school (he joined our school in grade 7), he didn’t like me and he thought i was annoying, i didn’t mind him in the group, we used to fight but now i’m nice with him. He still hates me but i gave up on trying to get him to like me. Him, along with many boys at school used to make fun of me and they used to say that i’m ‘gay’ because i don’t play football, and don’t do what ‘normal’ boys do. 
I’m not gonna get into the fights that i had with the group  but yesterday someone found my instagram bio, it was CEO of depression and yessir, they screenshotted it and sent it on the group making fun of me, i liked the bio and it was just me doing what i like, then they started making fun of me, i am not american and our first language isn’t english.
So i just deactivated my instagram and my twitter cause they didn’t like my tweets, my best friend that i mentioned i talk with her a lot and she was like just ignore them but she never defends me in front of them, she always does it privately, is she a real friend? Does she care about me?",2

test_pid_2848,"Feel in a fog : Wow. Today has been quite a day, and I'm so ready for it to be tomorrow. Let me start by saying that I am a thirty year old woman, and I've never truly classified myself as depressed before October 2019. My ex and I broke up at the end of the month, and things have been very rough for me since, but I have pulled through and most days are good days (Even though I know I want back what I can't have, and I am working on not thinking those thoughts). 
Today however, I woke up in a fog, but still managed to get out of bed, showered, and dressed nicely as I had to do a few things this morning. However I didn't feel myself. And by the end of the 4 hours, I was exhausted mentally, physically, and emotionally. So much so that I came home and just sat in the shower and cried for about 40 minutes. I have convinced myself that my Mirena iud is causing my depression as I get really ""low"" once a month, and that I wouldn't have had these arguments with him, mood swings, etc if it weren't for it. Idk if this is true or not, but I can't be thinking like this. We broke up, regardless of the arguments, I didn't want to convert to Judaism, or pare down my holiday celebrations and that was why we broke up. Who cares what else happened. Today though I looked at his social media for the first time in a month, and now I'm back to feeling broken, depressed, and just a mess. And I'm crying again.   
I can't really talk to anyone about this, as they wouldn't understand and would wonder why I'm still hung up on him so many months later, and why I am so emotionally weak. I'm not like a suicide risk or anything in case anyone was concerned, but I definitely don't know how to fix this. And it doesn't help that I just realized I have hours of online class homework to complete by tomorrow at midnight, and I can't even think to read the textbook, write the paper, answer the questions, etc.",2

I'm exaggerating way too much, this usually then leads to me thinking I'll never be as good as other people in the world who are so successful. And I have to be honest, it's really true. Why do I feel I have so much on my shoulders? I'll never be able to follow my role model's path and I know it. Then comes my sleeping schedule. I'm not so much of an early bird, I usually read at night. But I can't even focus because of the thoughts that fuck me up. I feel too insecure about myself and I just can't even focus. I normally then wake up not wanting to get out of bed for some reason. With these thoughts, I just can't do anything. I want to die but I fear that the people around me who actually CARE about me will be devastated without me in the world. I wish I was someone else. Someone popular. Someone smart. Someone who has a good schedule. Someone who has everything a person could wish for. I'm just so greedy and jealous. I think everything in my life should be perfect when others are dealing with things way more serious than my problems. I'm also very scared about opening up about my sexuality. I know there are LGBTQ+ but I don't feel opening up to ANYONE about it. I've heartbroken twice and that's pretty much what made me fear opening up about my sexuality. With my eating patterns, I just can't find the strength to eat enough. I'm also afraid I'll gain too much weight or lose too much weight. So I keep forcing my self to at least eat something, but it's just not working. I feel disgusted at myself. I'm such a disorganized, selfish, jealous and cold-hearted bitch.",2

But I am here te tell you that it gets a little better 
I have a big bear like 1,5 M tall I bought for my gf once (she gave it back after the break up) and whenever I feel sad I hug it and my world brightens up a tiny bit hugs do really help 
So if you have a friend or some you like or is special to you give them a hug and tell them how they let you feel better

test_pid_2924,"People with depression annoy me (pls read) : K I've said this before to people without any means to ""troll"" or whatnot. I just want to express my opinion but people don't want to accept my opinion or attempt to discuss it with me, really. Honestly I feel like if I'm open enough to my own idea that goes against 99% of what society says, I can be open to someone changing my mind/bringing info to alter my perspective.
So maybe the title is misleading. Maybe it isn't. I can't really tell but what I know is that I honestly can't stand hearing all these sob stories from people with depression....or what I like to say...""depression."" See I do believe mental illness is a thing. It's not anything set in stone because sure you can have underdeveloped parts of your brain and shit, but its all just a cluster of symptoms that will never be set in stone because all these diagnosis are made up just like anything else in the world, really. But anyway
Im sure we've all heard, or have all complained about, people who are so fucking nagging and sad all the time and attention seeking. I mean technically I am attention seeking at this moment because I am searching for replies and reactions from anyone reading this post. And my title was definitely attention grabbing because I can guarantee I caught the attention of many pre-teen girls (or boys (AND many also respectable women and men, who may or may not be mature and knowledgeable too). And no one can really stand them unless they're BSing themselves or are that exact person. But I'm talking people who are depressed in general... 
The thing is, I'm a total fucking hypocrite for this shit. I'm literally diagnosed with depression/anxiety/otber disorders that I don't want to mention because I'm afraid that there are some kids in here who will actually go research it and be like OMG I HAVE THAT TOO and have had my stays in hospitals, self harm, therapists, psychiatrists,  suicide attempts,  etc. Blah blah. Nothing new. But seriously I cannot hear someone talk about sadness and depression without wanting to roll my eyes. I MEAN I KNOW HOW TERRIBLE IM SOUNDING BUT I DO WANT TO WARN YALL THAT I DO NOT EXCERPT THIS ENERGY IN REAL LIFE. I'M VERY EASYGOING AND FRIENDLY IRL. 
I mean I think it might be because I've essentially made myself deal with everything myself. Not literally obviously because I've been in environments with psych professionals, but at this point I'm over it. I'm just sick of it. I'm absolutely sick especially of the people who are so fucking dependent on people and will do shit like get in a relationship to be ""happy"" and then when they break up, fall into some dumbass episode and go through the same cycle over and over. People who are dependent in general annoy me SO MUCH. 
People who nonchalantly bring up their issues too annoy me unless its in a closed environment with a close friend or something. Yeah I slip up because I like making jokes but when I make a joke about neglect or something I regret it immediately and am like ""this is the exact thing you hate,  improve for next time."" I just don't enjoy that type of attention seeking and when I do it impulsively I correct it for as long as I can.
I have a feeling this is because of my lack of a crutch as a kid or something. I mean I totally understand needing to open up but I think there's a time and place, not in front of 2 random people from school. 
Idk man. This is getting too long. Shit on me if you want. That will be fun for me. Or don't be mean and be nice 💓💘💜💘💕💘 also fun",2
test_pid_2925,"Never had a Girlfriend at 29 : I've dated here and there but never been on more than 5 or so dates with a single girl. Never had sex either. I'm unsure at this point how much this is actually damaging my psyche. I've wanted it so bad for so long, but I'm starting to wonder if I should just give up on it. The number of hoops you need to jump through just to have a ghost of a chance is ridiculous. I suppose I have been a bit picky in that I only consider girls I'm actually attracted to, but honestly that just seems fair to both parties. Has anyone in a similar situation significantly improved their mood by getting a first girlfriend? Or is it just ""grass is greener on the other side"" and it won't actually improve much? On the other hand has anyone who has never had even one girlfriend managed to up their self-esteem significantly while still remaining single?",2

test_pid_2933,"vent;; TW : i had a pretty intense conversation with one of my teachers on friday and it changed my pov on certain things. i dont see that teacher the same way that i used to. it made me very emotional and i cant stop thinking about it so i figured maybe talking about it here could maybe help.
ive been struggling a lot with my depression these past 2 months. my self-harm got pretty bad and im having trouble staying clean. my eating is very disordered rn. im losing weight. my dad is never home. im the one who has to take care of my brother most of time. i have a huge lack of motivation and school is a bummer for me rn. teachers have been noticing how ive changed since the beginning of the year and some of them have asked what’s happening. there’s this one teacher though,, my history teacher,, that has been very concerned and worried for me. he told me multiple times that if i needed anything i could reach out to him but i tend to feel very bad in these situations. i feel like my problems might not be important enough or im being annoying. last thursday,, i was in class earlier and he told me he was extremely worried and that he really wanted to talk to me. i didnt really have a choice. 
when friday came,, we had a 45 minutes long conversation on my mental health and i genuinely felt like someone cared about me for once. we spoke about my past with my mom ( long story short she emotionally abused me ) and the relationship i have with my dad. he also spoke about his past and i felt like i could relate to what he went through. i felt less alone. i felt understood. he gave me some tips and showed me videos that could help with my anxiety. everything went alright, until we spoke about depression and suicide. my dad found out about my self-harm last summer. not a lot of people know that i struggle with that. i regret self-harming just because of that one particular moment. anyways,, he asked if i ever felt suicidal and if i ever self-harmed. i don’t know what went through me but i had the strength to say ""yes"". 
then,, boom,, he told me he already attempted to commit suicide. my stomach dropped. this teacher who was always so cheerful and seemed so happy with his life once tried to end it all. 
i cant stop thinking about it. it made me so sad. im having so much trouble processing it.

She often says stuff like ""I have to go study"" when she wants to leave the conversation and then sometimes I'll see her 10 minutes later in another chat. This makes me think she's avoiding me. However we talk for quite a long time sometimes and it's not only me initiating conversation. But sometimes it just seems like she doesn't want to talk to me and it becomes silent quickly. We voice chatted about a week or two ago for the very first time and I thought it was fun, however it became awkward towards the end when I started becoming tired and losing energy.

acknowledge your faults instead of fighting with yourself

find passion in what you’re good at and get good at what you’re passionate in
remind yourself of things you could miss out on
worrying about the future changes nothing except the present. if the bad thing happens, wait to suffer until it does

So my mom passed in 2010, but a few years before that, I remember waking up one day like a switch went off inside of me. And I've never been the same since. Still to this day, I struggle with it. It's not a sinking feeling. It's more or less a ""I could be in a room full of strangers, and watch them all disappear and not feel a thing"" type feeling. Just numb and devoid of any care for anyone or anything. I remember when my mom passed away a few years after this, I was by her side. Everyone in the room was crying, even the nurses and doctors. Here I am holding the hand of my best friend in the whole world, after she took her last breath, and I felt nothing. Didn't shed a tear until 3 days later. It comes and goes.

test_pid_2947,"dating a guy who just started antidepressants : Ok, here is the rundown. I (25) started seeing a guy (26) approximately January 8th. We met through a mutual friend. We texted for about a week until we actually met up for our first date. Which went really well! Lots of chemistry and lots of fun. The next day (Monday) he proposed another date at the end of the week and we planned it for Friday. He took me to my favorite vegan restaurant and then we went back to his place and cuddled on the couch, watching Disney+ until like 2 am. 
The next day we were both separately out with friends drinking. He had been texting me consistently all day but around 11pm he expressed that he wished I would have stayed the night the day before so ""he could sleep next to me"". But then he also said he was afraid that I wasn't into him and that he had a hard time telling if I was into him because it didn't seem like I liked it when he kissed me. He said he was very into me. I just told him that I have always had a hard time opening-up and he understood completely. I ended up going to his place and staying the night. We had both been drinking though (don't worry, I ubered) and neither of us really had the expectation of sex. We just cuddled and talked. 
Nothing weird yet. A week goes by, we were still going strong. Texting ALL day, every day. We have a hard time meeting up during the week because we are both teachers and then he had a friend in town over the weekend. He also tells me that he had been medicated for OCD, depression, and anxiety since he was 16. But I guess he had been off of his meds because he said he had an incident at the beginning of the year that made him have a total mental health breakdown (3 days) and that made him get back on them. He said ""I've bee off of medication and on it and I'm currently in a weird place with it. I'm adjusting to new dosages and dealing with trying to find the right amount."" I understand mental health and tell him I totally get where he is coming from and to let me know if there is anything I can do (much longer convo but that is the gist of it). We also had the conversation of how, even though we had not been intimate yet, that I did not want to be just his booty call and he said that was not what he wanted either. 
 So then the next week comes and kinda the same thing. We finally make plans for another date on Saturday, two weeks after the last time I had seen him. But, on the Thursday night before we get out of school on Friday for snow and I ended up going to see him at his weekly pinball tournament and meeting a ton of his friends. It went so well and we got along great (he commented on how much they liked me). We had our date on Saturday. We had dinner and went back to watch movies. It was, once again, great. We made plans for a little road trip the next weekend for his bday, he was supposed to help me move in two weeks. We cuddled in bed and talked a ton, joked. When we watched movies he forehead kissed me and scratched my back. Literally such an ideal date for us. 
I leave the next morning thinking things are great. I don't really hear much from him that day which is fine. We both had a lot to get done. I text him late that night saying I had fun and couldn't wait to see him again and he responds the next morning with ""yea it was a good time for sure"" and the emoji with the glasses. Over the next few days it takes him forever to respond to things but is still randomly snapchatting me. After about 4 days (Valentine's Day) I go out with friends and get drunk. I end up texting him that I wanted to know where his head was but he didn't respond but he still snaps me the next day. I end up asking if we can get a drink that night but he doesn't respond. So I call and he doesn't answer the call but responds right away with a text saying he was celebrating his bday with his friends and was in a bar and couldn't hear. I say it's cool, hope you're having fun. I wake up with 6 snaps from him but don't snap him again until Monday-his birthday. I say HBD, he responds, and I try to make conversation but I don't hear back. I text him one more time on Wednesday, essentially saying I like getting to know him, would have appreciated some communication, and it wasn't like me to open up the way I have with him. No response.
My question- I know I have been ghosted and it fucking sucks. But part of me worries about him as far as mental health goes. Could this play any part in his actions or am I just reaching? I have done some extensive research on how antidepressants can affect personalities if it's not the right dosage and he did say how he was having a weird time trying to figure it all out. We talked about some personal shit and talked about the future of our relationship and then POOF. Idk this is not like his at all. I need advice.",2

Every day since we got here has been fighting nonstop, crying, barely sleeping and just wanting to die. And the funny thing is my stupid mother moved to Edmonton about 3 days ago with her new favourite ""child"", her new husband. Sorry about the rant, I've been working every day and not sleeping much. But what would you do?",2

test_pid_2965,"I have to let go : There’s been a guy I’ve known for about 4 years now. When I first met him we were dating after meeting on an app. We’d been seeing each other for a few months before I decided to end it. To give you a bit of background this was the first period in my life that I was the happiest I’d ever been. I’d lost a tonne of weight and looked great. I loved my job and loved where I was in life. Unfortunately that was my biggest downfall. I ended things because I thought I wasn’t ready and thought that I was too good to be in a relationship. That to date is one of the biggest regrets in my life. He was the kindest, sweetest and most caring person I’d ever met. He understood me in more ways than most people I knew then. But because of my own selfish needs I ended it. We saw each other a couple of times each year over the next few years. As I had regrets and I think he felt obligated to see me. Today however was the last time I would ever see him. After getting drunk most nights and messaging him paragraphs explaining how I truly felt about him over the past year he finally decided to meet up with me to help give me some closure. I truly believe he was the one and I hate myself everyday because I was the reason this didn’t continue. I destroyed him and his trust in people because I was fucking selfish. It was great seeing him but I know that it was the last time I’d ever see him. I knew nothing would become from seeing him again today but I needed closure and I know he wanted to give me that. Still an absolutely selfless and amazing person right to the end. I will never ever forgive myself for the decision I made at the time all those years ago. I would do anything and everything to go back and change it but I can’t. Now I have to live with that. We could’ve been so good for each other and that’s what hurts the most. Knowing I could’ve been there for him during all the shit times he’s been through. But I know for his and my sake that I need to now let it go and move on. It fucking hurts and will continue to hurt as it always has but I have no other option. He deserves so much better than me but it doesn’t make the pain any less severe. I know that people come and go but I have never been able to forget him or forgive myself. I’ll carry this cross for the rest of my life. Maybe I deserve it for being such a piece of shit or maybe it wasn’t meant to be. Who the fuck knows. I will never stop hating myself for this.",2

So today I went shopping to buy my sisters shoes for school. At some point the older one left with her aunt so it was just me and my youngest sister, going to stores and shopping. I brought her whatever she needed for school. Then we went to Burger King where she tried onion rings for the first time. She liked them. And I showed her a little trick that went over really well. She's a very sweet kid at age 12 before everything changes.  Afterward I drove her home after she got everything she needed for school and before I left her I motioned for a hug and she leapt from her chair and give me the tightest hug I felt in a while. It was amazingly satisfying, a real strong loving embrace that lasted longer than normal hugs. My  bones didn't feel so loved in a while. Really it's the only thing I needed as a thank you. She's good and I hope we could spend some more time together soon.

For reference we are both 15.
I'm not sure I should be sharing all of this online but I don't know how to help her and I feel that sharing a few personal details is worth it if I can help.
She is really depressed and has attempted suicide before, or at least come close (drinking bleach, cutting). She has been having a really awful week and has been beating herself really hard, including cutting herself for the first time in months (at least that's what she told me).
She is a really great person but if she ever makes a minor mistake or is even slightly rude to anyone she has a near emotional breakdown. She also has a severe anxiety disorder. As far as I know, her parents are very loving but remain somewhat ignorant, not fully understanding that she can't just ""be happier"".
I don't know what to say to help her, or how to make her feel better. I want her to encourage her to have better habits (not using self-harm as a punishment) but I don't know any tactics. I've thought about talking to the school counsellor about her but I'm worried that if she found out she would feel betrayed or something like that.

my history teacher (one of the best ones i’ve ever had) knew about my girlfriend (her and i started dating 1/25/20) and not a lot of people did, he told me he supported me. i have never had ANYONE be okay with my sexuality even my family put me down for it, but my history teacher? It’s really nice hearing that someone supports you for the first time, however.. 
she broke up with me on Thursday night, he noticed i came into school on Friday and that i was obviously upset so he asked me if i was comfortable talking about it and i just kinda shrugged because i was getting that feeling in the throat when you’re about to cry. he just told me he was there if i needed anything and left it at that.

She's engaged, yet we developed feelings for each other and crossed some lines. She ended our friendship. And I get it. I let my loneliness affect things after we had been close for a long time.
But this is all in the aftermath of a relationship that ended a little less than a month ago. She was a frantic mess and struggling with sobriety but she was still way out of my league. And she just ended it. She was nice enough about it, but it gave me a taste that maybe I could have a sweet relationship, and be a good father, and have that life. Before her, I was fine being a single recluse. But now she's all I think about, she haunts my nights, and she won't even return my texts. I am just so very alone. I can't seem to do anything but mope around when I'm not working.
But that's the thing. I don't want to die alone. I do want that life she gave me a taste of. But my heart truly cannot take the amount of dating and pouring myself out and trusting and have people reject me and slip away necessary to find that girl. I will feel deeply for each of them, and I will inevitably lose my 4 1/2 years of sobriety and lose everything I've built. I am not the kind of guy someone will choose over someone else. I feel I'm a good man, but that isn't enough.
I just don't know how to breathe at 11:30 at night anymore. Every second feels like she just left me. And now I have no friends left. I messed up something good because I was lonely and saw my friend as a girl and not a friend. I have no friends with, at least not the kinds of friends you can trust at all. God help me.

The sunrise is overwhelmingly beautiful, so is the smell of all seasons. I want to experience all four of them, but I'm barely able to seperate summer from winter.

test_pid_2984,"To those who feel dejected or suicidal but haven't told anyone : 
I grew up with my emotions being centered around sadness. Any joy, excitement, or thrill I experienced was always quickly reverted back to a state of melancholy and dejection. I was never clinically labeled as depressed, because I never told anyone how I felt; I was never examined. One reason why despair was so prevalent within me was due to not having conversations about my feelings, which only amplified my negative thoughts.
I still believe that I had good reasons to avoid talking about my thoughts with others during my upbringing.
1. My parents argued and were terrible and negotiating.
2. My parents hit me and scorned me which made me afraid of them.
3. My parents rarely asked me how I felt, which reveals further lack of consideration for my well being.
4. My sister and I mimicked our parents; we mostly argued.
5. Some people at school were bullies. Emotional expression was a target for them to attack; I was not willing to take the risk.
6. My extended family was keen on threatening and hitting children, which made them untrustworthy from my perspective.
My depression was initiated and perpetrated by the complete disregard that other people had towards me. Since I could not get angry without fear of attack, and I could not leave my situation; I was sifted into a complacency role as a dependent and anxious child in a merciless and unsympathetic environment.
If your experience is in any way similar to mine then I want to remind you of what you already know:
Your suffering is not your fault.
Your suffering is mostly due to the environment and circumstances that you are subjected to; by the design of your parents.
Sometimes we have to lie to others in order to protect ourselves from further damage that our peers and guardians will cause us.
Sometimes we have to lie to others, and that includes saying that we hate ourselves.
I am here to argue, that you do not hate yourself.
You hate everyone around you that allowed for and did not protect you from the predators that lurked within your tribe or community.
For that, I am sorry.",2
test_pid_2985,"I wrote this to another redditor. It just poured out so I figured maybe it might touch someone else. You are not alone. : I fought with this condition. Look, depression can make you feel like you shouldn't be alive. It makes you feel like why keep going with this pain. The colors if life, are just dull. Sometimes on a cloudy raining day, the blinds are all closed and either you are sleeping to avoid the pain or you sit there trying to watch TV in a neutral feelings state or listening to music. Music is a life blood for someone that is depressed. Sometimes it's the only outlet of all the sadness in our heart. You just want to be happy. 
So now that you know I can not only empathize, but I've been there. Sometimes it comes back even with the medications I take. But it's no where near the darkest hours I've faced. It helps so much when you finally get the right meds.. when you do get there, and I'll be honest it's not an over night thing, it takes years sometimes to fully benefit from it because there is no science to it like there is in other medical issues. So you have to try multiple, multiple, meds. But I kept going. I didn't give up.
Just because you feel like your worthless is because you can't get past the depression yet. On the other side of that, is a different thing. You learn to have self worth. That takes time. Years sometimes. But when it happens, the blues get so blue. The green of grass are green can get.
The magnetic field consists of positive and negative fields. Without positive, there would not be any negative fields. There is no light without dark, no good with out bad. There is a quote that says the following
""They say there is no light without dark, no good without evil, no male without female, no right without wrong. That nothing can exist if it's direct opposite does not also exist.""
- Laurell K. Hamilton
If you think about it, it is exactly that. That is the LAW of the universe. There is nothing else. You, me, and everyone else has the opportunity to see that light. You, do mean something. Your soul means something. Your life means something. We affect everyone we come by. If you want to be happy and find purpose, you have to look for the light in the darkness. Know, it will come. You have to do the leg wokk tho. Go get help. Forget money or insurance or even age. There is help. There will be light. Remember it's the law of the universe. It will happen. Don't give up for real tho. You are not alone. No. Not at all. Life for very dark for me. Very. But damn I'm glad I didn't give up.
Let me give you a song that I played on repeat on my saddest days. Idk if you are a guy or girl and that is irrelevant because it feels the same for all if us, but its ""Jon Bellion - One Way to San Diego"" idk why he named it that though. It has nothing to do with San Diego. But please, listen. At least once. 
So remember, it will get better. But you have to want to get to it. Do what you need to get help to fight this.  
Wish you the best, sorry for spelling errors, but my thumbs are now completely about to fall off lol.

I don’t have a problem with this anymore, I can work to save up some money and it’ll be fine. The one thing that has made me feel uneasy is explaining it to my mom, she supports me in wanting to get another degree, but is constantly asking me about so many things. One of these things is me starting in the Spring, I’ve vaguely told her about it, but she wants to know more about why. At one point I began to tell her, but stopped because I was reminded of a similar experience with her where I got so stressed out over something that I shouldn’t have. Since this did happen about a month ago, she has stopped asking me about it, which has helped me not be so stressed about it. However, today she had a conversation with my grandmother about what I plan on doing after college and she of course told her about me starting a Master’s in the Spring. My mom told me that my grandmother wasn’t really into the idea of me not going directly into the program. This is the thing that made me extremely uncomfortable, because I’m not close to my grandmother and she is not the type of person I would confide in about my personal matters. Last year I visited her when I went on vacation by myself to her country, and there were times where she’d be harsh/direct about things that would make me cry once I was alone. I’m a very private person and I don’t like sharing personal things about me, one of these being what are my plans after I graduate, so my grandmother’s want to also know more about me made me not want to share with her. Coming to terms that I am okay with starting my master’s in Spring has been something I had to slowly and calmly accept in order to not feel like I’m disappointed or a failure.

I am a college student who’s been depressed for many years. It started when my family fell apart, I lost all my friends and ended up home schooling and isolating myself for over a year. I had no friends, no social life, no goals or motivation to get up in the morning. I could cry myself to sleep. I ended up having paranoia and Obsessive compulsive disorder. It was hard. I couldn’t leave my house without checking if my door was closed 10 times or falling asleep not making sure no one was watching me through the window. But I moved on, finished high school, went to college and changed my life. It took me quite a bit to get rid from all the mental problems I had. But unfortunately, I am still depressed. I work, take classes, smile and make others think I’m happy and careless, but when I’m alone with my thoughts I struggle from my own self. I can’t stop thinking about how awful I am or that I am a loser. Even if I have friends it seems sometimes I’m not a priority to anyone. Like I’m a back up. If they are bored and have no one to hang with they call me. Luckily I found my soulmate. And he’s my boyfriend now, I’m so grateful for him! I decided not to spend time with people who don’t care about me. Do sports, study and improve my life. But when I’m alone I’m sad and needy. I’m always looking for new friends and I’m pretty sure I look petty. Since the beginning of the month I’ve been writing down every happy moment that happened to me that day. Even if I got a tasty coffee, I would mention it because little things make our life better. I just want to say that people around you don’t know you are depressed.

During a depression phase or anxiety attack when I feel the whole world is against me I think about little things. A delicious meal I made, a funny episode of my favorite tv show, a hot shower after work, a beautiful sunset! I understand how difficult it is, but I also know if you put an effort in making your life better you will eventually enjoy it more.",2

test_pid_3000,"My Online Friend needs help : First of all this is my first time posting and I dont know if this is the right place but I need some help for my friend. Here is some background:
I (M25) have a friend (F24) who I video-games all the time with and text and call for about a year. I dont know the specifics but from what she told me over the year is she is bi poler and depressed. She says she has been ""sad"" (depressed?) for 10 plus years. she listens to really emo music from what I see is ""suicidal music."" Because I only talk to her online, I am not able t support her in real life the way she needs it. She is always talking and joking about killing herself a lot ever since i met her and it scares me. She has attempted suicide a few time in the past and most recently she said something that hurt my feelings and after I told  her how i felt, she cut herself (something she has done many times in the past). A few months ago she took a lot of pills but after realizing she didn't want to die she went to the hospital and got help. Every time she drinks alcohol she starts talking bad about how useless she is and how pathetic and meaningless her life is. She sends every day sleeping, playing video games and getting mad at it or watching twitch. She used to take medicine for her mental health issues but stopped for reasons I dont know. From our conversations, she knows she has a problem but wont do anything to change it. 
I really want to help her but I honestly dont know how. She doesnt have many friends and as far as I know, none in real life that she can truly call a friend and talk to. I've tried the best I can to help her But she keeps pushing me away. She refuses to let me help her. not even a little. She says ""stop trying to be the bob the builder of my life."" To be honest I am exhausted. I dont know if I should believe her words or keep pushing her to be better or just leave her as she is. Its kinda driving me crazy always thinking if I made her mood worse, if I am being too much, if I should let her be alone. I dont want to leave her as a friend but at this rate I dont know if I can keep doing this and if i do distance myself she might really hurt herself. 
I am writing this now because she just hung up on me and said ""leave me alone.""
Has anyone been on either side of this kind o f situation? I dont know how I should handle this situation because she is very sensitive. any Advice? Thanks.
Update: kept calling her until she answered and I talked to her and she is in a better mood now. She is actually laughing at me XD.",2

Then I lost the job. I don’t know why I did this but I didn’t think of the repercussions and every once in awhile I’ll do something like that but I can’t control the urge.

test_pid_3010,"How can you make someone with severe MDD understand he needs a hardcore treatment, more than just SSRIs, when he refuses it? : Hello /r/depression! I'm **desperate** for help for my severely depressed bestfriend of 15 years, I don't know how to help him anymore.
He's 28 years old, awfully  stubborn, and don't, or can't, see how he's in the deepest ends of that black hole. He couldn't hold a job for more than 8 months in the last 10 years, he's been isolating and hermiting himself for years, medicating with huge amounts of alcohol and sometimes weed when he has money for it. He can't even see that he has an alcohol problem, its like he's in severe denial.
His family is from the soviet times, so they see it as laziness and not an illness. Only his grandma helps him sometimes, others from his family (father, stepmom, grandpa) gave up. All of our mutual friends cut the cord with him a few years back, they got exhausted from his behavior and how he won't do anything to help himself. I was the one all of those years that set up job interviews for him, since he couldn't do that himself. He has severe anxiety from talking to authorities, to the point he won't even call up his old job from 3 years ago to tell them that he didn't receive his last paycheck. 
His now ex-girlfriend, whom he dated for the last 10 years, broke up with him this last summer thinking that if he'll lose her, lose his comfort zone and the person he leant on, he'll get his *wake-up* call and will finally start doing things to improve himself, his well-being and life. That didn't happen. 
He got to the point his bank account got seizure since he didn't notify about his unemployment, got a debt since he didn't pay taxes. No money, and still won't get a job. He sits in the dark all day, drinks, smokes, and plays videogames. I convinced him to see a psych and now he's on Cipralex 20mg/day for the last 3 months. **No change.**
**He just sits and waits to die** since he's too afraid to commit suicide (his words).
I try to convince him to get hospitalized, at least as outpatient, he won't listen to me or anyone about it.
Me and my other bestfriend (his ex bff) and his ex-girlfriend had a long chat yesterday about his condition. He has been living with me and my husband for the last month, until yesterday when my husband mentally broke down and told him he needs to move back to his old place (a unit on his fathers land) - which he took up as rejection and it went very badly to the point I was afraid for my best friends life. Both of them said that until he will lose everything and everyone who supports him, his comfort place and maybe even a place where he can live, he won't take charge of his life. And even then, if he won't get treatment or do anything to help himself, it's his own fault and his own  responsibility to take care of himself. 
I don't want him to get to that point, but even now he won't listen or understand how deep he is in it. **Is there anything, someway, I can make him see it?**",2

In the past 3 weeks we’ve rarely hung out outside of group settings, its mostly the only place I am able to talk to them. i feel like they treat me differently when we’re in a group, than if it was just the 2 of us. I’m more often the butt if the jokes when they’re around, and I don’t feel like I can complain about it. 
I often see them prioritizing messaging in the group before responding to me, which didn’t use to be the case. I know it’s probably irrational and clingy to feel sad about that but I can’t really help it.

With some medical help, I managed to press my passive thoughts down and give up the suicide plan. Now my emotions are much more steady. I still don't think I deserve to live, yet I have no interests in ending my life for now. Then I find that I actually fear of being cured, if that means to have a hope of life and lose the courage to commit suicide when the hope is shattered by reality.   
I don't dare to have any hope. I feel so anxious about the future. I cannot bear if the hope is broken. I wish I could keep my existing attitude to my death -- I am not afraid of it and I will kill myself if necessary.

I had 9 Seroquels left in the bottom of my container and I don't know if that's enough, but I've been struggling with relentless anxiety and panic attacks since I've returned to school after some brutal set backs. I were to end my life, I would never get to eat chocolate again, have an orgasm, hear my favorite songs, never get to see another Summer night, etc. Those things may seem cheesy, but I often think things like ""what about my family and friends??"" Last night I didn't think about how others would feel if I were to give in. Truth is,  most people in my life don't understand what I am going through and all they see is the goofy smile and they laugh when I tell jokes. When I let my guard down, people always respond with toxic positivity and platitudes. I hear a lot of people telling me not to be depressed or get back on the horse. Depression doesn't work like that. If all I had to do was snap my fingers, I would have tried that already. Today I got some help and spoke with a counselor at my University and on my way home tonight I'm going to pick up a strawberry milkshake. Depression has kicked my ass this winter and I've lost nearly 15 pounds. I know this low will pass and there will be more hurdles to come, but I'm fighting with everything I got. If you read this far, you're awesome!! Putting my words out into the universe helps with the burden and I don't feel so trapped behind my mask.
Please don't give up.",0
test_pid_3019,"Don't know how to get better when I can't talk to anyone about my thoughts : It's too hard to talk to people. Even professionals.  
I don't have any faith that anyone can actually help me and the process of going through all my emotions again with some one who can't even help me anyways is too much.  Sometimes, I'm even physically unable to talk. I tried SO hard today to speak up in a mental health group I attend daily but i just PHYSICALLY COULDN'T. Which just made me feel even worse.  
Every single day I've been crying because how of pointless and hopeless everything is. My entire life has been racked by depression and I'm so fucking sick of half living but nothing helps. I'm tired of going through medicines and therapists and all this stupid shit when it doesn't do anything.  
I've been starting to feel suicidal again lately. I used to go to an emergency mental health center when I was feeling suicidal, but the last time I went there I had a bad experience and so all my trust is gone. I can't go there again and I don't want to go to the emergency room because they're just going to have me wait around anyways too.   
It's too humiliating to cry around people. I don't want to be around people when I cry. I don't want to go to an emergency room full of people when I'm at my worst just to feel like fuckin Boo Boo the Fool as i cry waiting around for 3 hours for some one to be available.  I also don't want to be committed to the hospital, either.  I'd just be going through unnecessary suffering being committed because they can't help my depression anyways. 
It's too hard to talk to anyone. I don't trust anyone enough to actually open up to them. I barely see my therapist these days and even the medication I take is getting harder as I have no income and they're getting too expensive with the small copay.  Getting refills is about to be 10 times harder because my therapist office is refusing to accept refill requests via email anymore. I tried ttelling them hey i PHYSICALLY CAN'T SPEAK due to anxiety when I use the phone and they're like ""Well u know u just have to call and u can talk to me or to ur therapist :) "" and im liek BITCH DID U FUCKING HEAR ME? i PHYSICALLY. CAN'T. SPEAK. It doesn't matter if it's you or fuckin former preside obama i'm talkin to i LITERALLY CAN'T. It's pretty damn clear I'm not being listened to or taken seriously. So,  my only option for refill requests is to now hope that on the  very few days where I'm actuall there each month, I've got enough energy left over after a therapy session to talk to some one else to request a med refill.  I guess again it doesn't amtter anyways since I can' afford the medicine and I can't ask my dad for more money,. I have no income because i can no longer work due to how bad my mental illness has gotten. Disability is IMPOSSIBLE to get so I don't even bother applying for that. I've been denied twice already. And the forms are too fucking difficult to fill out, it's SO MUCH, and because i can't open up to anyone or trust anyone, it's too difficult to try and get any kind of help from anyone to fill them out.   
I'm just so fucking angry and frustrated. This is all too hard. Seeking help is too fucking hard, it's too hard and painful to try and open up to some one when they can't do anything for you anyways and you just don't trust them because you know they just don't care at the level you need them to. I can't talk to my dad about anything because it's too hard worrying him or explaining anything to him. I don't want to be around people or make friends or anything, it's all just too difficult.   
I really don't know what to do. I really really don't want to live like this anymore, but I'm not strong enough to do what it takes to get better because I can't TRUST any of the people that are supposed to be there to help me.  I go to a daily mental health group program everday and no one ever obthers coming to check up on me. I was told that I'd get a weekly check-in with my case coordinator but it doesn't end up happening. Today, one of the coordinators there took my easide to ""cHeCk iN"" she said, and im like ""okay cool, finally maybe some one is showing some caring about me!"" and it turns out no she didnt' wanna check in she just wanted to scold me for something  idid in a group last week and hten send me on my way without asking me how i been doing. its too hard to approach anyone myself, and its hard enough to speak up when people DO come in and ask hme how im doing. i literally have no way of communicating to some one i'm doing bad if they don't even bother to check on me, though.   
it's just all so fucked. I don't know why i'm going there every day when i don't feel like it's doing anything for me. it hasn't opened up any new avenues. it's just taking up time in my life and making me exhausted cuz i have to be around people for like 5 hours each day.  it's so hard finding places there to be alone so that i can at least cry my feelings out a bit. they don't want you to 'isolate yourself'  so there are very few corners or places to hide, but i mean they also don't care about you soooooo???? i mean i get that yeah, they would care if they could it's just each coordinator has a lot of othher cases so they CAN'T be paying special attention to any of them and if i don't go to them for help or lie when some one asks ""are you okay?"", they can't know there's something wrong but it still boils down to they don't care and I don't trust them enough to talk to them because of the fact they don't care and feel lied to.  what's the point of being htere? at least when i'm at home i can sleep in bed all day and i can cry in my room by myself without being humilliated by people around me wathcing, and i can snuggle my cat, who DOES care about me. 
i'm angry because i went to a partial hospital program in january after being suicidal for a while and i'm so dumb because I actually came out feeling hopeful that things could be better and i feel like i was lied to. i'm sick of people only caring about that i'm alive physically. i don't feel alive mentally.  i have people that love me and care about me but at the same time,since they do love and care about me, they wouldn't want me to suffer anymore right? so even if I kill myself and they're said for a while, they should understand that it's ultimately okay because at least I'm not suffering anymore.  The weather is getting warmer which is really going to end up affecting my suicide plans because one of them is entirely dependent on the weather being freezing temperature and the other relies on people not being out and about too.   
I'm just so angry and frustrated and depressed about how shitty everything is. I don't want o do this anymore. I think about having to live another 40+ years like this and it drives me up a fucking wall to think about.

I have two understanding parents who very much want to see me get better, health insurance that let's me get affordable meds and regular therapy sessions if I so desire them, an ""okay"" track for the future (it's not great or anything, but I doubt I'll ever end up homeless or something like that), and so much more. I've got more things going for me than not, and yet I still make little to no improvement simply because I don't have the discipline necessary to make significant progress. I'm thoroughly aware of how much work it takes to get past depression, but knowing that just discourages me. I can't even apply myself enough to clean up my own fucking apartment regularly, and that's just the third step in the nigh limitless list of things I'll have to do to truly get better. My entire life is an monotonous story of dashed expectations, abandoned projects, and missed opportunities all completely owing to my own lack of conviction. I am being totally honest when I say that I have never once accomplished anything of note through raw determination. Everything of value that I've ever done has been the result of external forces coming together such that I never had a choice **but** to see the task to completion. That's never going to happen with fighting depression though, and I know that. I'm the deciding factor in whether my life gets better or not, but I'm also a lazy failure with no real achievements. Whenever I'm in a *mood* and see myself in the mirror I can't help but think: ""This is the guy who's supposed to reverse this whole trainwreck? Really?"" If I can't find the motivation to get better, why am I still wasting time and taking up resources while I pretend to try? Seems like dying would spare me both the trouble, and the grief that would invariably accompany my eventual failure.",0

Been struggling mentally for a really long time. I wrote my suicide note and was about to do it before being stopped by my boyfriend and family.

I live about 5 hours from home and ended up going back home for weeks in order to get help.
I’m going to a therapist twice a week now to manage my PTSD and I had to come back for one day in order to do a presentation and go back.

I think it means something that I came here despite how I was feeling. I think it’s a step in the right direction.",0
test_pid_3036,"I’m not joking when I say I’m ready to die. : I feel that nothing matters anymore. My family doesn’t treat me with any understanding whatsoever when I’m in a slump, and I’m seriously okay with the idea of dying.
Just as some background to help... I’m 19 and I’ve been diagnosed with depression for 10 years. Yes, as stupid and odd as that sounds, I’ve been diagnosed since I was 9 and feeling this way even longer. I have been to four doctors in that time and none of them wanted to help me. The one I’m on now, number four, legitimately won’t even try. I’ve done everything but jump on her desk and scream that I’m suicidal and willing to die or ready to start self medicating. I’ve been on every single medication there is, but she won’t adjust the dosage of the medications that do need adjustment. Yes, my depression is treatment resistant, but that doesn’t mean I should be kept on the same dose of Xanax I was on when I was 11 (I rarely used it until recently, it’s not given me relief for years and I’d only taken it like twice a year until a few months ago). She won’t listen when I said, before I was even using it regularly, that I get no help from it when I’m panicking. My panic is constant, even though on the outside I don’t show anything anymore in terms of my everlasting terror.
Doctor number four keeps trying to push TMS on me, but I don’t trust it and I don’t want to pay $700 in copays for something that makes me uncomfortable. She is legitimately trying to force me, and if I had any kind of confidence I might try raising some flags to the main person at the practice because she’s not giving me any other options and she won’t listen when I tell her that I will truly never ever want to try that or pay for it let alone commit the time to that. 
Anyway, nothing helps me. I’m always ready to break down and my sister constantly berates me. She’s younger than I am, but she has more opportunities than I ever had... yet she makes fun of me because I’ve not gone to college when she knows full well that I cannot afford it and with my luck I’ll never have any scholarship opportunites because there’s always someone better than me. My father makes fun of me with her over everything, and my mom gets sick of me fast.
The only thing that makes me feel any better is temporary and ends fast but it’s long drives to nowhere with MCR blasting in the car with the volume up almost all the way. As soon as I get home from escaping I sit and want to die again. LIke I’m willing myself to just disappear. There is nowhere that I’m safe and nobody I can talk to. It’s been about six years since I last physically sliced into myself, and I feel worse than I did then. I feel numb in every sense of the word. When I’m not numb I’m on the verge of a break down.
I don’t sleep, I don’t really eat, and I can’t do anything worth my time. I don’t have a job, I had to quit my most recent one thanks to a coworker repeatedly calling me retarded after me explicitly stating that I have Asperger’s and she always blamed me for her mistakes (which does not turn out well when you’re both pharmacy technicians and when she’s the one that loses the fresh bottle of oxy and I got blamed, but she did get in trouble for that one and not me), when I mentioned it to HR I was told to suck it up and get over it. The other staff members did the same things to me when I only ever kept my head down and did my work, I only ever complained about the schedule because it was impeding my ability to go to the f***ing doctor. I was hired “part time” and scheduled six days a week, they tried to call me in on my one day off, and I was NOT allowed to be unavailable on days when I’d had something planned for over a year or had an appointment at a doctor’s office. I can’t get hired anywhere else because I live in the middle of nowhere and there aren’t enough jobs so I don’t get any calls for interviews. I see the same job I’ve applied for posted multiple times, even after I’ve applied for the position about 10 times and never even get an email telling me they aren’t interested. The job before that had already started breaking me, but that one completely shattered the small amount of mental health I had left. 
I don’t even dare ask doctor number four about disability because she doesn’t even listen to a word I say. 
My point is that I literally want to kill myself and get it over with. I’ve never been on a single date, I have no friends, and the only living being that actually cares about me is my dog and even then she’s more than happy to spend time with the other members of my “family”. 
I have no hope of ever finding someone to keep me in line or stop me from sinking further and further in to my terribly self destructive habits and I have nothing to bide my time with. 
If there’s a reason why I shouldn’t just dig razor into myself somewhere I won’t be found so I can die in peace I would love to know.",0

Nope. My wife took me to the ER and they concluded that I had a TIA, or a mini-stroke. They ran every kind of test on me and could not find a blood clot, so they assumed it dissolved on its own. 
I went to my regular physician for a follow-up. He thought it was odd that I had a stroke. I'm not exactly old(50) or a smoker or extremely overweight or any other of the other risk factors. Then he kind of said something in passing about how stress and depression can also cause these kind of events. I was shocked, but when he said it I knew that's what happened. I've been so super-down for the past half year or so due to not working, money issues, kid issues, etc. and no one is really listening to me at how bad off I am.

Anyway. When you read these things - depressive episodes, etc., on the internet boards, there is always someone who writes things like ""you are strong"" or ""there are people who love you"" or ""it is going to get better"" or some other cheerful nonsense and ""good vibes only"" (as if I control the fucking vibes and they don't come on their own and try to lead me to the nearest bridge).
Previously, it could drive me mad, nowadays not so much, but still (yes, yes, it is ""someone is wrong on the internet""). What is that supposed to mean? We are anons on the internet. You don't know whether that guy is strong or not. You don't know whether he has people who love and support him.
Is it because of the discrepancy between someone's dire situation and the ""support"" that comes in the form of the most blatant, canned cliche?

test_pid_3047,"Increasing my dose of antidepressants doesn’t help. : I was diagnosed with depression from ~5 years ago and ever since I’ve been put on meds per the instructions from my shrink. At the beginning I was only taking one pill of Zoloft a day, but after a few months I didn’t feel any improvements and was still as suicidal as I used to be. I thought the meds didn’t work so I stopped using them for a while. Then things started going into a downward spiral from there. I stopped seeing shrinks and refused to meet any therapist because deep down inside of me I’ve always had this sense of distrust towards anyone beyond my closest circle. I’ve grown tired of telling them my stories over and over again. Two years from when I gave up on my meds my parents forced me to see another psychiatrist, and this time she simply suggested doubling my usage of Zoloft and I should see improvement in a few months’ time. I felt a little better during my first couple of weeks on added dosage, but after that I guess my brain has grown used to this extra input of sertraline so I gradually went back to my older pessimistic, suicidal self. I’ve had a couple of unsuccessful attempts at overdosing throughout the years, and now I’m prescribed to a laundry list of meds for depression, anxiety and sleeping problems. Sadly, after taking this cocktail of meds for months even the smallest trace of improvement is nowhere to be seen. Maybe this is how it’s meant to be. I’m now halfway through my grad school program and I’m aware that I’m just too exhausted to carry on. Being surrounded by all these motivated, normal people makes me loathe myself even more.

So i don't really know how to start this, guess i'll ""introduce"" myself first?   
So yeah i'm around 20 years old, studying in college and i've had depression since i was about 12(i think? that's when i vaguely remember trying to kill myself for the first time (well not exactly but i do remember trying to choke myself, whether it be trying to *actually* die or not)).  
Anyway, so since then i tried a few more times, only one of them being actually 'close': naive me thought i'd die by gulping down a few pills heh.
But that's not what this all is really about.
So as i said earlier, i'm at college, and in a kinda particular situation. I did my first semester almost fully last year, but dropped out of my second, which means that this year I only started at the second semester. 
Last year when i dropped out i pretty much *explicitely* told my parents i needed help (long story short: sent a message saying ""hi, i can't do school anymore, need to go home or i'm gonna hang myself""). But what happened is that i just stayed home for almost a full year, barely getting any psychiatric help, although i knew i needed it.   
After that year i went back to school kind of by default. And i do wanna continue though, because i don't feel like i'd be worth anything without a degree, and it's something i'm genuinely intrested in, so i wanna do it.  
Thing is, since i only started second semester i don't know anyone, like, at all. the only person i would have known is someone living in my dorm, but he dropped out. That combined to my solid social anxiety, i know i was gonna have a hard time at getting to know anyone this semester.   
So anyway, semester started, went to my first lesson, my second, my third, and that's where it got oopsie. Had a bad day, didn't go to my third, or my fourth, and that's how the thing snowballed. Although i kept following my courses at home, doing my homework, stuff like that.
But know i don't know how to go back to school. I feel like if i'm just gonna barge in some class i've never been to, after it's been going on for 3 weeks, i'm just gonna get 'judged' or something or at least feel out of place. (sidenote: there's an anime ""outbreak company"" where the MC talks about why people are hikikomori's (basically reclusives) and that's *exactly* how i feel rn).

test_pid_3050,"I don't think I'm clinically depressed anymore but I've been suicidal recently : Hi, I guess I'm just here to vent. Sorry the sentences are blunt. I'm very, very tired.
Had severe depression for a few years. Dropped out of highschool and had to delay my entire life because of it. Got better and came off my meds June of 2019 (More like forced off my meds (long story) then gradually got better because the side effects were killing me). Spent a few months dealing with withdrawal then felt better than ever. Haven't self harmed in a year. Started enjoying and appreciating life again. Kinda got my life back and I'm hoping to get into uni soon.
Recently I've been feeling very hopeless though. I notice that whenever I do feel this way for a while, my mind will just turn to thinking about killing myself. My uni exam is in two weeks and I just can't bear the thought of failing. It's been too much, too many years of failure after failure. 
I've been extremely exhausted. The pollution here is horrendous. I have to travel 3 hours to my tutoring school and 3 hours back, usually late at night. It's only a couple of days a week (since July last year) but lately I feel like I'm barely able to keep myself standing up properly. From today, however, for the next two weeks, I'm gonna have to come here everyday. I know it sounds like I'm whining and im sorry but I this is how I've been feeling. I feel like I have brain fog most of the time, which worries me so, so much. I've been super anxious lately. Even when I just stay home I still feel incredibly tired. I haven't been enjoying eating anymore, I feel like it's a chore and incredibly annoying (maybe that's why I've been tired.) My period is late and I've been losing hair again. I know I'm probably just stressed and not thinking properly and there are solutions to every problem but.. for some reason it just makes sense to just skip to the end already. 
If we're bound to die anyway, and we're not gonna remember any of this, none of it's gonna matter when we're gone, why bother? Why struggle so much when all that we've worked for is gonna be gone in an instant? We're gonna lose everything in the end. We're not gonna even have the consciousness to feel sad about losing it.
The only thing that's keeping me here is being afraid of hurting the people I love. I cannot let them feel the pain of losing someone. I attempted suicide once, and the guilt and seeing my family crying from that time has been part of the thing keeping me from seriously doing it again. But dammit sometimes I wish I could.

test_pid_3056,First time I completely open up about my depression. Any advice or similar experiences are appreciated. : I remember being depressed for the longest time but I'd always been able to pull myself out of it and I never lasted long in that state but around a year ago I plunged into a depressive episode and I haven't been able to get out of it. I noticed that these short depressive phases I used to have were developing into something more when I completely lost all ability to feel any kind of emotion except anger and sadness. I became completely numb to everything and I couldn't feel anything for anyone in my life. I hate to say it but even my mother who means everything to me I stopped feeling love for. I started to drink a lot and I wouldnt be able to focus for more than 2 minutes at a time on something. I spent 90% of my time in class either asleep or watching shows. I couldn't study my grades were dropping and frankly I didn't care and I seriously considered dropping out of university. I cant even begin to explain to you how irritable I got I would get angry and annoyed at the smallest inconvenience in my life and everything would piss me off. One of my friends got in a really bad car crash and was paralyzed and the only thing I felt was annoyed because I had to take time out of my day to visit him in the hospital and the whole time in was there I was thinking about how much longer I had to pretend before I could leave. I was continuously pretending to feel happy joy excitement empathy at all times of the time because I knew those were the correct feelings I should have but I just didnt feel anything. Back in September I went to see a psychologist and she officially diagnosed me with depression but I only went to see her twice before I decided to stop going. I never tried to hurt myself but I would wake up every morning and wish I hadn't woken up. There was just one instance in January where I was driving on the highway at night I closed my eyes and let go of the steering wheel but only for a moment before I grabbed it again. I think that was when I knew I reached my lowest point. January I saw a psychiatrist and I started on Brintellix but I had to stop it 2 weeks later because I got really sick and I never went back to my psychiatrist so I could start on it again. When I was on it I dont know how it was possible but the second day after I started taking it I felt like myself again my body was literally tingling I felt surges of electricity and so much love for everyone and I was genuinely happy. After stopping it I can say I'm not as bad as I was before but I'm not good either. I still feel all those things but I am more able to study now and focus in classes. Yesterday I found out that my grandmother who I love so much most likely has cancer and has a surgery tomorrow and she might not make it. I feel terrible about saying this but when I heard the news I didnt feel upset I mainly felt annoyed that if something happens to her I'm going to have to miss out on a lot of classes so I can support my mom. I dont want to feel this way anymore I feel like a monster and I dont know how to get out of it. I feel like the longer this lasts the deeper I get into the hole and the less likely I am to get out if it. Or if I do get out of it it will be more likely that I will get back into it at the smallest inconvenience.  Am I ever going to feel like myself again? I just want to live a normal life without feeling like I'm one bad moment away from drowning,0

test_pid_3067,"I’m not okay : Last year in late June 2019 I quit my first job out of college. I was there for less than a year since I graduated in May 2018. Before then I got an apartment in the city and I was excited to start my life. I worked as a paralegal because I was considering going to law school, then I saw firsthand how miserable the lives of attorneys are. I enjoyed the tasks but the work environment was so toxic. I grew more and more anxious and felt such a deep sadness that I didn’t even know what brought me joy anymore. I quit in June and then started working as a real estate agent as I thought about what I wanted to do next. I figured if things went well enough in real estate, I could make a career out of it. Well, I live in a major city and competition is through the roof. No one in the office helps me or answers any of my questions. I’ve asked 3 agents out for coffee to hear their advice on the business and literally everyone has said this isn’t a profession, it’s all commission, it’s too difficult, you’re too young, etc etc. 
I look like a very calm, at peace individual, but inside I hold on to everything. I cry a lot at home. I force myself to still stay active, go out for social activities, and so forth, but nothing takes away this aching pain inside of me. I’m 23 years old and I feel so lost in life. I put a lot of blame on myself for majoring in journalism when I should have done something like engineering and actually get a livable and comfortable career out of it. Ever since I quit my job I’ve been living off of my savings and doing so is incredibly stressful. 
I always thought I knew what I wanted to do in life. I had such big dreams of working as a journalist only to work in the business while I was in school and discover it’s not what I wanted at all but it was already too late. I graduated at the top of my class in university and I can’t help but look at where I am now. Still relying on my mom to help me with rent even when I did have a job. She’s in a great financial place to help me and encourages me consistently which I’m grateful for, but I don’t want to have to rely on her financial help because I’m an adult and I should have this all figured out by now.
I need to give an answer if I want to renew my apartment lease by April and I don’t know what to do. If I don’t have a job by then I won’t be able to and will have to move out of the city back home, about 2 hours away, where jobs are even scarcer to find. 
I met a developer, investor, and realtor who owns his own small business in the city near my apartment and he’s been almost like a mentor to him. I saw him yesterday and explained my situation to him. He told me that if I wanted to I could leave the current real estate company I’m at and go work for him and he would give me all of the rentals and sales his business has and walk me through the process. I told him I’m hesitant people even make a living from this because right now I’m at a luxury real estate company and clearly people are doing well yet they refuse to help. He said it’s all about competition but at his business it’s literally just him and one of his friends. He’s already very established in life so he doesn’t need the business, he just keeps this local real estate shop open to help out friends and family. I know he’ll help me, but I’m worried about not having a stable/fixed income or a secure job. I found an opening for another paralegal position and think I might apply. The pay is a lot better than what I earned in my first job, and because this mentor lives so close to me perhaps I could work with him part time. He assured me I could make a full time salary with him, but because I’m so responsibility and security driven I worry about having a commission only income. 
Even if I do work as a paralegal again it’s a job that leads to nothing. There’s no growth within any company, you’re just stuck there. And I absolutely do not want to go to law school. So here I am with no clue what in the world to do. 
I’m putting so much pressure on myself to have everything figured out. I’ve been stress eating a lot recently and that hasn’t helped. I feel so down about myself and what my life has become. Rents in my city are outrageously expensive and to find roommates is a complete nightmare. Everything I love pays absolutely nothing. Being an adult has taught me that people work themselves to death doing something they hate 95% of the time. I don’t know how I can live like that. Painting used to bring me so much joy and now I struggle with just being alive. I don’t understand why people have children when life is this difficult. I feel so lost and I don’t let myself just mourn this time of uncertainty because I can’t, I need to get out there and be an adult and pay my bills and move on because life doesn’t stop for anyone. I feel this heaviness inside and I don’t know what to do.
I’ve contacted 3 therapists and one took over two months to contact me, and the other one month, and the other I never heard back from. I hate the situation I’m in and as a proactive person I want to have my life figured out and the fact that it’s in shambles is ruining me. 
Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you get out of it?",0
test_pid_3068,"I can feel my happiness slipping away and I'm desperately trying to hold onto it. : Maybe writing about it will make me feel better. 
It's been months since I've felt truly awful. Things have been looking up, overall - I got a raise at work, I'm getting my debts kinda in control, I'm still in a decent relationship. 
But I can feel it all fading. It's like waking up from a vivid dream, where you can watch things slip back into normalcy as you come to your senses.  The fire is fading, and the world is getting colder each day. Colors are losing their vibrance and I'm hopeless to try and stop it. 
This illness is a curse -a monster that hides in the deepest recesses of my mind. Some black, unknowable mass of bile and writhing, hateful tendrils. It sits there, waiting for the perfect opportunity to fuck everything up. I wish it were as easy as people think it is to rid myself of it. These social media positivity charlatans insist that happiness can be found in a walk through the woods, or in the gym, or in the arms of a lover but it's all horseshit. The disingenuous, saccharine sweet wholesome bullshit is tiresome.

test_pid_3069,"My story with medical gatekeeping and why American healthcare is a sick fucking joke : *From the top*,
I have depression and PTSD. I've had the former all my life. I was diagnosed with the latter last year, but have probably had it for far longer. It only began to take over my life after I was raped in 2018. I have had to be sent to a mental hospital for med adjustments and suicide prevention on multiple occasions over the last 5 years. Until about 12 hours ago, I had been withdrawing from my antidepressants and hormone treatments. I had started withdrawing about 3 days prior. I spent those 3 days being shuffled around and gatekept by everyone with the authority to help me. Meanwhile, withdrawals and brain zaps were fracturing my brain and causing me to howl like an ape over the phone to my own mother. 
I was denied a refill of my antidepressants and hormone medication about a week and a half ago, around Valentine's Day. None of my medications realistically require regular checkups, but from what I understand this is legally required for all controlled substances, be they antidepressants or Adderall. So I told the pharmacy OK, order a new script. They told me no, talk to my doctor, they probably want to check on me before giving me a refill. Despite everyone's insistence that this happens regularly, I have never needed a checkup for antidepressants. I have not been examined for hormone treatments since 2018. They've just given me the fucking meds. In reality, unbeknownst to me, the practice the pharmacy was ordering these ghost meds from, which was the wrong practice and *not* my primary care, had silently closed their doors. No word of this at all to me. I wasn't informed of this until calling them today, over a week later. Meanwhile, I attempted to call my primary care, the real people writing my real prescriptions. The separate, now-closed practice wrote me a prescription once as a one-off thing, and that's why they were in the pharmacy's records at all. The latter practice was what my pharmacy requested my new prescription from. However, my primary care's voice menu, separate from the other, closed practice, was broken and hung up the call before I could even speak to anybody. In effect, they were hanging up on me. So I went back to my pharmacy and got a 3-day prescription to hold me over until I could get an appointment. The average psych schedules first-time appointments at least a week out, if you're lucky. I went through those meds in the blink of an eye. When I went back for another, I was informed that I could be given only one 3-day prescription regardless of how long I waited. ""Talk to your doctor."" I told them I couldn't, because they were hanging up on me. There was no way they believed me. They just repeated themselves then sent me home without meds. This was around Friday, the 21st of February. I spent from then until Monday unable to contact anyone, and withdrawing from my meds. The pharmacy was just totally down to let me do that, I guess. Meanwhile, the original request they had made to the closed practice was just floating in the ether, being faxed to no one. At this point, the denial was four-fold: my primary care was giving me the cold shoulder, the pharmacy was refusing my meds, the practice I called for backup just up and vanished, and my new insurance hadn't been updated in pharmacy records yet. No one was explaining to me why now, of all times, my meds were being taken away. As an extra layer, my family had changed insurance in 2020, so no prescriptions written could even be paid for until I eventually had that updated. None of this was communicated directly to me. I toughed it out and spent Friday-Monday withdrawing from all of my meds, then went back to the pharmacy on Monday to explain my situation. I was told again to talk to my doctor. I explained that I couldn't, because they were hanging up the phone on me. The pharmacy insisted they could not help me. I wasn't sure what else to do at this point, so I had my best friend take me to urgent care that night for emergency Rx. Withdrawals and brain zaps were making it hard to walk and talk, so my body was only letting me sleep from early morning to late afternoon, and urgent care was the only place that was open besides the literal hospital. Despite this, urgent care insisted that they were unable to write prescriptions for antidepressants, and redirected me to the ER. So my friend drove me to the ER. While we were in line, we got a front row seat to about 8 cops tackling and arresting a rowdy kid in a wheelchair. After about an hour in the lobby, I was called to the back. I was then made to wait in an ER bed for about 3 hours. I got a nap out of the whole thing, at least, as well as a request for 30 days of meds from an RN. Hell yeah! All I had to do was pee in a cup, because Lord knows I coulda been doping on that desvenlafaxine! That was worth me giving them an unmarked, untraceable bottle of my pee that they now just kinda have My mother insisted to me, whilst I was losing my shit over the phone, that this was the fault of the opioid crisis, and not that of the moronic bureaucrats that created it. I love my mama, but she lives in this weird quantum state where she is simultaneously saving my life and lecturing me about why all of my feelings are wrong. I dunno. Mothers. So long story short, I got to go home from the ER with an alleged prescription in my name for 30 days of meds. Great. I went the next day, Tuesday, to my pharmacy to pick it up. I was told that the original request was still pending and to talk to my doctor. It was only *then* that I was informed that the lost request was going to the closed practice, and it was only then that I called the now-closed practice as backup to discover that they were even closed at all. I went back to the ER to see what the deal was and ask for a paper copy of my prescription, on authority from my mom, who is very experienced with bureaucracy. After another 20 minutes in line, I got to ask for a paper copy. After another few minutes in the lobby, an RN pulled me aside and found the log of the prescription from Sunday night. I wasn't permitted to leave with a paper request, so the guy called the pharmacy I had just left. The pharmacist there found a prescription under my current legal name and the meds were apparently waiting for me this whole time. That wasn't what I was told! So I went back to the pharmacy one last time, asking what the deal was. It was then that I had found out that the pharmacy had not yet updated my last name, because my old last name wasn't updated for whatever reason on my insurance card from 2019. Mind you, I had my new insurance card in my wallet with my current full name on it, and I didn't know where or with whom to udpate this information, so requests were being made by like 5 different people under 5 different names for the same 3 meds. None of these requests have gone through yet. This much was all figured out between myself, my mother, and pharmacy staff over about an hour long conversation. It was only then that I had my name and insurance properly updated for both the hospital and the pharmacy, and it was only then that insurance would pay for the prescription from the ER, which they could now finally see. Once that was all said and done, I still had to pay 20% on my parents' HSA card. I tore open the packaging in front of the lady as quickly as my shaky hands would allow and gobbled the pills down right there. And I ate ice cream cause I fucking earned it.
I asked my mom why it took this much. She told me ""give it a few days to figure it out"". I could tell she was trying to tell me, diplomatically, that I'll realize in time that this was my fault. This is what happens when I try to have a backbone about fucking anything. What was the point to going to all this therapy to improve my self-esteem if it's so fucking scandalous to everyone around me the moment I do? Why am I the asshole for wanting meds as soon as I need them? It's not personal, I just want my brain to fucking work. Sure, hindsight's 20/20 and if I could navigate bureaucracy flawlessly, then yeah, maybe I could've had meds before I ran out. But I didn't because I'm 23 and no one taught me this shit. Why is that my fault and why do I have to suffer for it? I'm not even sad anymore I'm just fucking furious that this is what I have to deal with. But apparently I was supposed to just take all that shit lying down and say thank you for dessert. Why is everyone so dead set on shoving trans women into a grave, huh?",0

We went through all of the major symptoms together and he agreed that I was exhibiting 7/9 diagnosable symptoms and recommended I meet with my doctor for an assessment.

And that because I don’t want to kill myself my doctor might not take me as seriously. I’m relatively functioning most days, but the lack of motivation is so debilitating some days that it takes the entire day to get through one homework assignment or a tiny chunk of studying.

I can't make appointments, I can't go to the shop without severe anxiety, I can't write a cv or a cover letter to apply for jobs, I couldn't finish my degree that I spent 4 years studying. I still feel like having my ex back would make me feel validated and loved, hoping it would kick start my life but I know now she won't ever come back because good things don't happen to me and even if they do I'd ruin them. 
My mood swings are crazy, I'm so irratable I hate it, I have random moments where ill sob for 20 mins straight just because I miss her and just want the happiest moments of my life back, even though I ruined it for myself and I'm just angry at eveeything.

I'm disliking a whole gender because of a few girls who have broken me. 
Something is seriously wrong with me besides depression, I don't feel in control, I don't have a grip on myself, I don't know if my emotions and feelings are true or if I can trust myself or not.

I never thought my future would be this but then again I didn't actually have a plan for the future so I guess I can't complain. All is my fault and if I want to get better I have to do it myself no one can live my life for me. After all the debate in my head I always come to the conclusion of death. It's so sad that life has become so unlikeable that death actually excites me. I wouldn't harm myself because I'm a coward, but I'd be happy to hear I have a limited time left here.
I've played enough and maybe I haven't tried as hard as everyone else but I see this as natural selection, I don't have it in me to fight, I don't want to pass on my weak genes. I envy those who have stable minds and can do things just because they have to. Most likely I'm just super lazy and stubborn but Id rather die than to fight to live in a world where there's lots of people but not enough humans.
The solution to my problem may seem very obvious to some of you and that's awesome but I have zero reason to live or lack of will to live. Zero ambitions zero dreams. I just feel like if I could get my ex back then I'd be happy again and I'd feel good about myself. Automatically your brain will say no that's toxic and not how it should be  but how do I explain that its how I feel inside and can't budge from it and how low it makes me feel when I think of her. I'veost my identity and truly feel like I can't make it through life alone and without her. I smoke in the hopes of getting cancer and then I can finally be free from this suffering, wish me luck.

test_pid_3076,"Spitballing my problems for the first time - not sure what a good path forward for me looks like : (Mostly) First time poster, and honestly, just discovered this subreddit (even though I knew one must have existed out there).
Over the past month or so, I've come to terms that what I am experiencing is, at the very least, in part due to depression. I have yet to see a therapist (and should begin shopping around, to be honest), and it was easy to put in the back of my mind when coupled with other medical problems I'm trying to sort through (incidentally, if anyone wants to take a stab at my recent post in [r/AskDocs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/), I certainly wouldn't mind...).
What really prompted me to start talking about it was the physical manifestations from my depression. I cried for the first time a week or so ago since 2012, for pretty much no reason. I was sitting on my couch, knew I couldn't just ""be alone"", and called up a friend, and just immediately tears started streaming down my face. We didn't even talk about anything consequential, mostly TV and video games, but it was helpful and eye-opening at the same time.
I dunno what more I should/can type. I just kind of spitballed a bunch of my thoughts, and its made me feel a tiny bit better. I'm open to advice and suggestions. This is new to me, in the terms of even acknowledging what I'm feeling. Thanks in advance, folks.",0
test_pid_3077,"10+ year depression : I am 53 and have been depressed for over 10 years. I was extremely successful at one time but have not been able to obtain that level since. I was laid off in 2009 from a great paying job that I loved never had another job since. I still had a good side business but that eventually went under in 2012. After trying to find work without much success I lost all motivation and gave up. After my money ran out I have been surviving by the grace of family with some money coming in here and there from real estate. While I once had a beautiful house I lost I now live in my deceased grandmothers house in a lower income area, while I am thankful I have a roof over my head the run down neighborhood adds to my depression. 
I have had a wonderful relationship for 5+ years that ended 3 months ago because of my depression. She was so supportive and tried so hard to get me motivated to get help but I always refused. She wanted to get married but I always had a dumb excuse why I couldn't. After 5 years of trying to fix me and my unwillingness to get married she said she needed to move on. I know if I showed any interest we would have stayed together but my twisted mind thought if I can't give her the happiness she wants let her go find it...and she did. I took her for granted and thought I could just continue without her but I was wrong. 
Over the years I have alienated all my friends from not showing up or talking to them, damaged close family relationships because of my depression and not realizing it threw away the only good thing I had in my life. We truly loved each other but the depression became too much for me to over come. I would give anything to have her back as I now realize how important she was to me and how much I truly loved her. She was the one thing that kept me going on even through the depression. Now without her my life is empty, meaningless and has no worth. It feels like the final straw.
As depressed as I have been I never had serious suicidal thoughts much until now. I no longer see a future or light at the end of the tunnel. At 53 the chances of meeting someone again in my situation is next to impossible. I just feel so alone without her. She was everything to me and it hurts that much more that the only reason she is gone is because I couldn't find the strength to try. 
I am still trying to fight but hope is fading. All I see is a lonely miserable future from here on out and  I can't go on with this pain anymore. The only thing stopping me is the devastation it will cause to my mother and daughter. I don't know where I am going with this other than I need to vent. I would never talk to somebody about the seriousness of my intention to kill myself. It is just so hard to try and continue to live. I threw away the last good thing I had in my life.",0
test_pid_3078,"My life has been trashing me since about age 15 : I'm 20 now. I'm extremely lonely, I struggle with unmedicated Schizoaffective disorder, OCD, panic disorder, and several more completely unhelpful verbal designations. I'm Gay and incapable of finding a partner either physically or digitally but I want at least some connection VERY badly. I've gotten fired repeatedly because I'm too ""weird"" for retail, but that is the ONLY job that exists in the United States now that does not require either a full time schedule or like 4 college degrees and a multitude of skills I don't have. I am flunking out of classes because I'm lonely and depressed as all hell. I have seen tens of therapists and cannot be helped by a single one. It's a back and fourth with me and other people, where I am constantly told I need help. THEN, after all of this, I finally decide ""ok, I gave it my best and society/life and the world are rejecting my existence, I should just leave this place"" I get put in a fucking hospital where someone throws up on me and I hear screaming sounds all night and I'm not allowed to leave because I'm so panicked that I don't fall asleep, but then they force some powerful drug up my ass and then I have to fight falling asleep because every time I do I hallucinate shit and panic, then they give me medication after medication until I fucking collapse and I feel like shit for days. I will never tell anyone I need mental help again, because every time I do I suffer for it.
In my view, these are basic needs and easy to meet. I just want to love someone and have a house. THATS ALL. I used to have dreams but I realized I am not allowed to have dreams. I want a job too, but I am too stupid to hold them. I'm not a hard person. I'm not evil. I don't know what I did to cause this. I don't know why it's so fucking hard to do stuff that everyone else just figures out. I can't find help, I can't find a relationship, I can't even fucking find a friend. I can't FIND anything. It's like you're trapped in a room and told to find the key but they forgot to put the fucking key in my room.
I'm full of hatred for everything because after a point you can no longer tell yourself ""it's my fault"". Because I feel like it's not my fault anymore. This is relentless. This is caused by someone/something else, some other system in place.

I had a traumatic childhood, due to my abusive and alcoholic stepfather. As a teenager, I was in a relationship, but it ended by the time I was 18. That girl, wrecked me to the core. She completely destroyed me, and my self esteem. When another girl came along, I liked her and she liked me, but I couldn't do anything about it, because I felt she would only use me like my ex. I started to drink and perpetrate crimes, getting arrested, then released without charge. I became arrogant, pig headed and mean. Now, I'm 24, and have no friends or relationships.

A few months ago the new therapist I was seeing at the time wanted to talk about my severe depression to which I reacted “I have severe depression?” I guess I’m just so used to feeling low that I thought I just adapted to it. 
One of the things that has bothered me most over the years is my complete loss of motivation and energy, especially regarding things I do particularly well. 
I used to draw a lot as a child and so many of my teachers and peers were sure I would be an amazing artist some day. I used to love creating portraits of my idols, dead or alive. I can’t even bring myself to pick up a pencil nowadays, and it’s been like this for years now. I walk by my art supplies collecting dust, and I see everyone’s lovely art posted on the art subs I follow and it hurts because I feel like my potential has been stunted, halted, paused in a way. I also loved to sing and I would belt out my favorite songs, I even used to sing in public and my heart would soar with happiness whenever I got a standing ovation or felt proud of myself for reaching/holding newer notes and getting better. Now, I don’t sing in public ever. I barely even sing when I’m alone, the most I’ll do is hum, and that’s on a good day. I’m afraid if I sing now I’ll sound stupid or wonky or someone will come along who is better than me and more vibrant or hard working, someone with a “go-getter” attitude that I can’t envision in myself. 
I cry frequently nowadays. I feel shackled by the monotony of my pathetic life. Pain seeps in and I feel myself wanting to desperately isolate myself and allow myself to wither away into oblivion despite knowing that I have people who love me and care about me. Some days are okay, and I manage to laugh here and there, but the bad days feel never ending. I yearn to have that spark back in my life. I want to create things and be the person I’m meant to be.

I’ve been seeing a therapist for 2-3 months weekly. I told her in my first session that I used to have depression. I’m 21 now. 
I’ve been seeing her (mainly for other things that I needed help with) I would tell her my feelings etc. I never thought I had depression any of those times before. 
Last Monday I went to her and I told her how I feel like I have no personality and that I feel like a shell of a person. Anyway, she told me right then and there that I had depression the whole time. I was so shocked because I wake up and do everything day to day but upon looking, I guess I did have it. 
She recommended I go back to my psychiatrist and try antidepressants again. I used to take Lexapro. 
Anyway, I took 10mg last night and today morning around 10:00am I get super light headed and passed out. I later went to work at 12:00pm and I got lightheaded, and fainted on the water dispenser. After waking up I felt a burn. I burn a huge area around my butt and leg. A 2nd degree burn. (I went to urgent care)
Now I feel so guilty. I felt guilty when I told my parents on Monday that I was diagnosed with depression. They didn’t understand and told me not to take medicine. They said it was all in my control. They blamed me for feeling bad because they give me anything I ever wanted. 
I feel so guilty now. Before I passed out the first time. I called my mom and told her I wasn’t feeling well. When I woke up my mom said “did you know what you told me over the phone? You said you were suicidal!” 
I didn’t remember saying that.

When she finally told me she was in love with the other guy, I was already broken inside, so when she left me alone with our baby, depression kicked in for real and destroyed my rationality. 
I took many pills and I nearly died 3 times. I don't know why but I fought for life, even getting up by myself when the ambulance came (worst physical pain ever).
When I got out of the hospital, they told me I was fine, and I believed them.
But now that I am alone and that I can't see my baby, I'm realizing they were wrong. I can't sleep at night, the slightest inconvenience can ruin my day, and sometimes I regret that I fought against death.

I try to be as joyful as I can, I blast some heavy riffs through my headphones and headbang as hard as I can, I'm actually flirting again with girls...but god damn, I went through so much abuse that no matter how much I fight against my mind, I always remember that I was emotionnally and sexually toyed with.

test_pid_3095,"Is anyone just a void? (1st post) : There are so many layers to my depression, like there are to anyones, so I’ll focus on the now with a little background.
I was a very shy kid with a lot of anxiety and I was sinking into depression by the end of elementary school. Things just escalated by the end of high school and now college. I was always going through everything alone, handling everything by myself, and the reasons for that would be a whole other post. The thing is, I’m really functioning, like you wouldn’t tell I was suicidal and severely depressed, I come off more as an asshole. I also never had some traumatic event which could have been a trigger for all of this, although one could argue a thousand little traumas can do a lot of damage as well. Me functioning as I do and the lack of visible damage has always led me to thread this line of where I am not sure if I’m making all of this up or if it’s real, which could also be a whole other post ha.
But the thing I wanted to ask, just to find someone who feels like this, is anyone just empty? Like, I joined the gym last summer after around 8 years of wanting to go, but my anxiety being a huge roadblock. I am planning a pilgrimage and hike a lot as it is. I study to get good grades and so on, my point being I seemingly have goals and ambition. But I just feel like a void. I see no point in anything life offers. When I set my mind for something I just wait for it to be completed and then I move on, almost completely dissociating from this thing, no matter how joyful it was. I feel detached from the world, I zone out a lot. I feel nothing I do during the day is a valid justification for me to be alive, like I am wasting time and space.
I’m not looking for sympathies or anything, I just felt like writing this to see if someone can relate. There were so many times I was so much worse and writing smth like this could have maybe helped, but writing calmly like this now makes me feel I won’t just delete this in 10 minutes. Just posting this is out of my comfort zone, but fuck it. 
PS; I am seeing a psychologist, I was seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication for a while but stopped ‘cause it made things worse.

I got a call that the meds were ready for pickup but I was at work and as I had just had my performance review the day before (it wasn’t good) I didn’t want to leave.

Tried therapy... tried exercise... tried relaxing. Actually they do work, but I just can't stay consistently doing any of them for very long until another health problem or some fucking college family bullshit comes up. I have ADD too, so hahahah doing anything that requires discipline.
When I graduate I will have spent 8 goddamn years of life in this institution, if I never have to study for another fucking exam again it'll still be too soon. Teachers have interminable classes and drone on and have their material scattered all over the place, making everything difficult, and then blame me when I do poorly. Yeah yeah work is worse, blah blah. That's not motivating me. My goals drift away while all this abuse continues. The worst is trying to put on a mask for other people and pretend like I'm not depressed because mother dearest bitches at me or acts sad if I try to indulge in 'the basic pleasure of openly hating \[my\] life,' as that one youtuber put it. 
The only consolation is that I'm one of those insane child prodigies that entered the system years early, so I haven't lost that much time. It probably did more harm than good, in the end. I have two rotten molars that have been that way for almost a decade and a left ear that's had some kind of issue for a few months and anytime I bring this up she meanders and finds some way to put it off.

Sick of being shoved around, and sick of my only outlets being games, jerking off and reading terrible people's terrible opinions online.

Sometimes I find comfort and something like thrill in fun media, good food or evenhobbies, but it doesn't last long because that's how the human mind works. What my mother's doing is probably illegal, but I have no way of proving she doesn't let me out of the house (physically blocked my way once and took my phone), and if I tried to talk to someone beside my therapist, in meatspace, about my abuse they'd probably think I mean physical abuse. I have OCD as well, because fuck me, and I treat every manmade surface as potentially contaminated which means I can't eat out properly anyhow. 
All these issues have been there for years, but it's only last year I realized my mother was abusive and it's only in the past few months that it's gotten truly grave. I tried as hard as I could to study and keep up but it just wasn't enough and I got another kick in the shins when the teacher said my assignments -- the ones I worked so long on -- were worth a small portion of the final grade. I've finally had enough, and I'm starting to disengage from reality. 
The thing I look forward to most at this point is sleeping; my dreams can be terrifying or tense, but at least the constant background of pain and low-level self-hatred isn't there. I'm tired of being a self-contradictory mess ideologically, I'm tired of my past mistakes, and I'm most of all tired of trying to climb out of the pit just to have my hands slashed. If there were an easy and convenient method of suicide -- like a fast-working poison -- available to me, I would likely have taken it. Easier than trying and failing to get better for the next forty or fifty years. There. That's my rant.",0
test_pid_3102,"Persistent depressive disorder : I suspect I am suffering from Dysthymia for some time now and I only learned about it some days ago. All the symptoms match. I feel no satisfaction or pleasure in life although I am still able to work, have social interactions and lead an apparent normal life. Even the things I always liked such as play bass, sing, video games or reading give me no satisfaction. I still do these things but in 'auto mode'. Besides the lack of satisfaction, I feel enraged. All the time. Everything pisses me of literally. This is going now for a year or so, I think. 
I went to a psychologist for the first time last week and since it was my first appointment, nothing was done. We just talked and I didn't know that there was this condition then. I just told her that I feel my life lost its meaning.  So next week I tell her about this Dysthymia thing and hear what she has to say.
What bothers me the most is that this is really not helping my relationship. I live with my SO for four years now and she is also struggling with depression. She has the 'classic' depression: sadness, anxiety and some episodes of panic attack but she is seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist for some time and undergoing treatment. However, if she had emotional support from her SO, things would be much better for her, I believe. I don't feel like being around her anymore. We occasionally watch something together or play some board games (I am always in auto mode when doing these things) but that is all. We do not talk much as before and it's been two months since we had sex, and I feel absolutely nothing about this.  I really don't care.
Today things got worse. We argued when she said I don't give her attention. She is right about this. However, I am simply not able to give her attention or love. I wanted to show her love but I can't. If I did it would be fake. It would be in 'auto mode' and I don't believe this would help. I am really dead on the inside. I just told her I feel nothing for her and I am not feeling sad about this nor angry, nothing. She is devastated but said she prefer to hear the truth.
I almost left home but she convinced me to stay. Told her to go look for someone else who could actually give her some emotional support. She said that she cannot do that. It would be wrong to leave me when I also need help and she stills loves me.
This can't continue. I must try to do something. I want to feel alive again. Anyone here has been diagnosed with dysthymia or maybe feel the same way as I do? Have you tried to do something about it?",0

test_pid_3106,"Experience with prescribers? : Long time lurker, first time poster here. Some backstory to my questions:
I went through counseling with a therapist two years ago, for an overall period of about a year. I had weekly sessions to start and trailed down to once a month once I was feeling able to manage my thoughts a bit better. I stopped going when I felt like it was no longer beneficial and that I didn’t get enough out of the sessions. I did actually enjoy seeing this therapist (unlike a previous one years ago). 
In the last session we spoke about potential next steps, and I mentioned that I would be willing to try medicine to try to even out my mood. My therapist said that medicine can work for some people and not for others. He recommended a nearby “prescriber”, basically a psychiatrist instead of a therapist. Some therapy is still involved but less frequently, and more as a quick check than a full session (those are shorter as time goes on). He cautioned that they generally don’t accept insurance and can be very expensive. 
I’m experiencing symptoms of depression again, and in the back of my mind I know I need help. There are some persistent thoughts that I haven’t been able to shake in addition to general feelings that I can feel aren’t really me. 
Has anybody had experiences seeing a prescriber or psychiatrist specifically for medicine in order to try resolving their symptoms? It feels odd to seek out a doctor in order to try medicine, but I guess that’s what we all do when we’re sick. Please let me know if it was beneficial to you, if you learned anything useful, or even if it wasn’t for you and why. 
I know it’s time to get help but I also feel that it may be time to try something different. Thank you guys for reading and for your thoughts!",0

test_pid_3114,"I've Never Experienced True Happiness : Looking back on life, I always thought I was a happy kid. But now that I'm older, I realised that I was never happy one minute of my life. I was born into a destructive family, both parents being chronic alcoholics, and too wasted to care for me or my siblings. When I was 5 my dad suffered from a heart attack and died. My mother was incapable of looking after any of us and we were put up for adoption. I was placed into a house where both parents hated one another and divorced one month after I arrived. I stayed in that house for 8 years, and in 2017 I left because I was being abused and treated like an object. She would threaten to kick me out of the house if I misbehaved, and at one point threw me out on the side of the road for something or other. I was like a slave. I did all the household chores, cooked, cleaned... I had no time to socialize which has come back and bit me in the ass now. I attempted to kill myself while I was there, but failed. I didn't have any friends, so no one could comfort me when I was feeling like shit. Whenever I was at school, I was the weird kid; always alone, talked to myself (probably insanity), and somewhat schizophrenic. I never felt safe anywhere, and as a result I can't trust anyone now. When I moved schools in 2017, I was partially excited because no one liked me in my previous school. But it is so much worse. In the the last three years students have made fun of the way I live, made fun of my looks, and I have had death threats on countless occasions by numerous people. Again I tried to kill myself because I wasn't taking anyone's shitty insults anymore. I got real close to slicing my neck open until I was caught and sent to hospital. Sometimes I question why I'm still here if I'm just going to be beat down by almost everyone I meet. And I still have no friends to talk to about these things. It sucks. Life sucks. I suck.",0

Have always been struggling with it but after a back injury which left me with chronic pain for a year about 3 years ago, I went off the deep end and made some reckless choices. My marriage was going through a lot of turmoil, she cheated, I cheated, we divorced. I drank and slept around to make myself feel better and while I felt ""alive"" for a while, I crashed and burned. Even though we both cheated and are better off not together, I still feel so terrible for cheating and for breaking up with her. Shes engaged and happy again and has forgiven my transgressions, but I still can't forgive myself. I'd never cheated on anyone else before and it tears me up inside thinking how I hurt her at the time so badly. Feel like a monster.
I've been with someone new for a few years now and shes great, but she deals with depression too. I want nothing more to be happy but I find myself resenting her negativity, even though I am the same way I suppose. Its sick. I'm sick.

I just kind of run through the motions with my negative self talk. Then I turn. Talking too much about nothing to the point of arguing because I just want to connect with someone on anything.

When I get text message reminders that I have my appointment with her, I become nauseous and I dont want to eat. My last session with her my voice was shaking. She told me that she is concerned for me and that she wants me to feel free to talk about anything. Since last week all I have been thinking about is that sessions and that gives me anxiety.
 I took it personal when my therapist changed her availability and made herself unavailable by choosing to work four hour days. This makes me think that she dosent want to work or even worse does not want to see me. She has told me in our previous sessions that I am always free to call as long as its during office hours. When I am in crisis, my first thought isnt going to be is if she is in office or not. I called last week for an appointment during the same day because I was unable to make an appointment last week in advance and I saw her that day. When I got there both of the receptionists and my therapist told me that they dont do same day appointments. This was the first that I had ever heard of that. Both of the receptionist told me that I was able to make a same day appointment before which made me really confused. I feel like they all hate me.

I lived in a good city, got my bachelor´s degree and could just do 1 more year of part-time studying to get a job with a good wage. Had a girlfriend, lived together, I went to the gym almost every day and I felt great about myself.
Then I decided to move to the U.K for a year to do a master´s degree in something that I may or may not get a job within back in my home-country. Mind you that I already had a student loan of $45 k, now I borrowed an additional $35 k to come here. For what? I´m a supporter of the football team that resides here, I´ve followed them since I was a kid. Relationship was a bit unstable at the time so my best response was to flee (breakup was not bad at all, still friends). Now I´m sitting in my ridiculously small, crazy expensive student´s accommodation, I live with 4 people who are 6-7 years younger than me, all my friends from uni are working all the time and the course I´m doing is not at all what I thought it would be (I only have a few months left and my master´s dissertation that I may be able to do from home). I regret coming here, my social life is a mess and I miss my friends and family back home (everything about my home country really).
I´ve suffered depressions before due to illness in the family as well as bullying when I was a kid, but I thought I was done with this. I had worked myself up to a respectable social life, lots of friends. I had shed my excess weight, I looked good and felt good. Now I will sit in my room and procrastinate, eating the cheap candy they sell here (I come from a very expensive country), playing videogames. I finish all of my assignments at the last second. I´m constantly thinking about going home but with the financial commitment I´ve made to come here, it would kill my parents (or rather, they would kill me). I don´t know what to do. I feel the relapse coming, all my negative thoughts about myself are constantly weighing me down and it has made me a lazy slob. The first thing people said when I went home for christmas was that I had put on weight. And how right they are.
I just needed to vent my thoughts, don´t expect all the response in the world, but any advice would be appreciated. Have a lovely day.

test_pid_3126,"As predicted, the ""doctor"" was a complete waste of time : I had a bad feeling that I was wasting my time and it turns out...yep that was right
So apparently whatever is wrong with me is too severe to be seen by my original provider so they referred me to an outside provider. Cool. After a series of hoops and headaches I get an appointment. Changed my work schedule so I could make it because there wasn't a promise I would be able to reschedule soon. Came into my job at 5:45am so I could get there on time without losing hours at work. 
My appointment was supposed to be with a woman...but apparently that was changed without notifying me. I DEFINITELY would've cancelled in that case but whatever, I was already there. Get in this dudes office and he immediately tells me that I have PTSD. That the depression is just a symptom of that. I'm like ???? He says these are the types of things people with PTSD usually experience. I tell him I don't really experience that. He goes on about PTSD. I ask, so did my original provider send something over that makes you say that? He said no, they didnt send over anything related to my care. Keeps talking about PTSD. Says he sees lots of people with it and he's ex military so he knows (but I've never been seen by you before???)
Then he says he's not really into medication (????) Says he believes in holistic approaches like herbs, acupuncture and the whatnot w a combination of therapy. Says he will refer me to therapist intake. I was clear that I wanted to go the medication route and wasn't interested in ""herbs"". He says well if you're sure we can do a swab test and maybe start you on a small dose of zoloft but other things would be better. I said I'd take the swab. So he says sure, but I'll also put you down for therapist intake (???)
So I leave and he gives his instructions to the nurse. Once he's gone I tell her 1) Under no circumstances do I want to be seen by him again 2) I said I didn't want a therapist intake there and 3) Just please give me a prescription so I can go. So she says sure...then sends my prescription to a walgreens to be filled. I leave...head to the Walgreens...and the pharmacist goes...Didnt they tell you? We dont accept your insurance. You have to have this filled with your original provider. 
...No, no one told me that. It's after 5pm. I call them and they are closed. He says you can still pick this up, but you have to pay out of pocket. I call my original provider and they're like, well yeah obviously we have to write your prescription and fill it (then what was I referred for???????). I asked if they knew the ""doctor"" they had me see was selling herbalife and snake oil on the side. They said they go through a third-party for referrals, there's a lot of doctors in the system. 
At this point I'm standing in the middle of a Walgreens near tears. Not depression tears mind you, rage tears. I just paid for it out of pocket because I wanted to go home. Oh and by the way my insurance won't reimburse me. Because according to them someone should've known where to send the Rx. So fuck me I guess.  But I can't take it because I'm definitely not going back to that place to have it refilled and I need SOMEONE to tell me why I can't just been seen by my original provider.

test_pid_3130,"Same Day Appointments : I have been having some adverse reactions towards my therapist lately. In December we took a break from our relationship because we both had things to do. When I came back I was really anxious. I had never been so anxious seeing her. I thought that the anxiety would go away but it always come back. Whether I call to schedule an appointment with her, think about my appointment with her the night before my appointment, while waiting for my appointment in the lobby, during our sessions and after my anxiety ramps up. When I get text message reminders that I have my appointment with her, I become nauseous and I dont want to eat.
I called last week for an appointment during the same day because I was unable to make an appointment last week in advance and I saw her that day that I called. When I got there both of the receptionists and my therapist told me that they dont do same day appointments. This was the first that I had ever heard of that. Both of the receptionist told me that I was able to make a same day appointment before I got to my appointment which made me really confused. My therapist also never mentioned I cant do same day appointments before. When they all treated me like that I felt like they all hate me. It bothered me that she gave one hour to the client before me, I usually get 45 to 50 minutes. I wonder if she gives other clients more time than me because of what I saw last week.
During my session with her my voice was shaking. She told me that she is concerned for me and that she wants me to feel free to talk about anything. Since last week all I have been thinking about is that session and that gives me anxiety.
I took it personal when my therapist changed her availability and made herself unavailable by choosing to work four hour days. She knows that I dont have a lot of money and that my work schedule makes it hard for me to come. Her changing her hours makes me think that she dosent want to work or even worse does not want to see me. She has told me in our previous sessions that I am always free to call as long as its during office hours and I do and she was supposed to be unavailable.
I don’t really know where this is coming from. I was expecting the anxiety to go away by now.",0

test_pid_3132,"Floating/Sensory Deprivation Tanks : I've been on 4 different SSRIs, I've been seeing therapists since I was 14, and my depression hasn't let up. I have dysthymia, but have found myself in another major depressive episode and dropped out of university 2 days ago. I'm now on the path to taking the time out of my life to put a conscious effort in getting my mental health on track. I want to exist in harmony with my depression, so I've been trying to find natural therapeutic techniques to cope with these really bad episodes. Today, I tried floating in a sensory deprivation tank and it was absolutely incredible. I spent 3 hours in there, and it made me realize that I have absolutely no time to think. Taking time out of your life every once in a while to think about who you are and what you need to do provides so much clarity. I felt so at peace for those 3 hours, I wanted to cry having to leave because I know the outside world is full of so much pain. But, the benefit is that I now feel better equipped than I did yesterday to conquer this pain.
Anyone out there who's reading this, and suffering, there's no harm in trying a float tank. If you're into psychedelics, I really recommend doing a float under the influence of mushrooms or MDMA to push the limits of your mind. It helped me when I thought nothing else could, I hope maybe it can do that for you as well.",0

Secondly my therapist was only in his office two days a week, and was taking on a lot of new patients and couldn’t find a time that didn’t conflict with my schedule so he had to refer me to someone else. Thirdly I lost my job and health insurance so I couldn’t afford therapy.

test_pid_3142,"When depression starts to take over your life... (21 F) : I wrote this earlier today. Maybe you can relate. Please take the time to read it... 
Most days I feel nothing at all. I can’t cry, I don’t laugh, I’m just numb.  Then there are days like this where I feel everything at once, yet I still feel silenced by it all. The feeling of being suffocated by deep sadness. It’s as though everything has no purpose and I can’t find myself to accomplish anything. You know deep down you mean so much to so many people but it’s clouded by the thoughts. Nothing seems logical. It’s days like these where I feel restrained by my own self and yet again I let another day go to waste. I don’t eat, I didn’t shower or brush my teeth, my hair is in the same bun I put it in before I went to sleep last night. There is nothing worse in this world than being stuck in your own head. You’re told it can go away but it hasn’t. It’s a constant battle within yourself. After you get over the mountain of depression, you hate yourself even more for not being able to control it sooner. You don’t know how to ask for help because no one really understands how you feel. So you suffer in silence over and over again. This is my problem that I should be able to take control of, but I can’t and I haven’t so I continue to live through it time after time. You stop answering texts and calls, you cancel plans and no one knows it’s because of how depressed you are. You come up with excuse after excuse on why you can’t make it. I know I need help but what is a therapist going to say differently this time? The thought of driving over to talk and feel the exact same leaves me even more hopeless. Calling the doctor to change my medication because it’s not working is a big task that I don’t want to go through - driving to her, trying a new medication, experiencing new side effects, spending more money that I don’t have because I call out of work so often since I can’t get out of bed. I feel defeated and mentally exhausted. Some nights I’m awake, tossing and turning, hoping I’ll be able to put my mind at ease but I end up suffering from insomnia. When I finally do sleep, I wake up late and am disappointed with myself for sleeping and wasting half my day that could have been used to pick up the slack from the previous days when I was paralyzed from depression. Other nights I sleep 12+ hours. It’s like I can’t win. How are you supposed to feel when depression is taking over your life? You’re close to losing your job, your grades are terrible, you physically don’t take care of yourself anymore. Not to mention all the things you used to love to do, you can’t find the energy or passion anymore. This is when you start to fantasize about death. It just seems so promising. No more suffering. You can finally escape the constant sadness. Is there really a better answer? Will I ever understand what true happiness feels like? People tell you there is hell out there but it’s only temporary. The vicious cycle seems to pick right back up, especially when you least expect it. Doesn’t matter where you are, all you want to do is go right back in your bed, alone, away from everyone and everything - isolated one your own sadness. As I write this, I realize I need help and I want help but I’ve done it all before yet I’m still here, worse than I was before. It’s like depression evolves as time goes on and one day it will be too much to handle. That’s when you know you can’t fight anymore.",0

But for the last few days depression is back with no explanation at all. I know something is terribly wrong with me but I don't have a clue why. Was it the show I was watching that was a little disappointing or the stress of my rent going up? I have Bipolar2 so I shouldn't be shocked I guess but it's been so well in control for so long because my kids are great and my love for them brings happiness. These last days though I can't get myself into mommy mode at all. I feel devastated, like there is no future to look forward to, and that I wish I could tun off my brain and wake up next to one of my old friends that ditched me a while ago who I used to tell everything to....I'm pathetic I know. Maybe that's ok but it hurts.",0
test_pid_3144,"listened into my moms convo with my lazy brother and now I’m somehow lower than I was before : I’m too tired to write out my whole backstory but long story short I’ve had bad depression since I was 12 (20 now), I’m really good at hiding and bottling up my emotions so mom doesn’t notice most of the time. I told her a few years ago that the incidents of my middle school haunt me everyday and that I have depression. 
She put me up on some vitamins and told me I need to exercise more. 
I’ve only seemed to get worse as the years have gone on. I used to be able to work through it and keep going with it just on the back burner until I was alone in bed at night with my brain. 
Nowadays, I’m unfocused. I’ll lay down for bed and realise I don’t remember my full day of work and school. Today I woke up and realised I forgot to shower for an entire week. I’m spiralling really bad and so this past Monday I asked my mom if I could get professional help. 
We talked for a long time and we set me up with a therapist that I’ll start seeing within the next month. I’ve never gotten professional help or medicine for that matter the entire time I’ve been going through this. 
Anyway, I’ve ranted a bit too much. Basically, about an hour ago, I heard my brother (25, unemployed, cliche lazy guy who plays games all day) complaining about having to start work for the first time in months soon. 
Mom went off on a tangent about how his laziness has led him into this “funk” and how he won’t be able to handle the hard work of his upcoming job bc he’s gotten so used to laying around all day. 
Then, I hear my name. She starts to say that the reason he and I are having mental problems is because we both didn’t have jobs during last semester and got so used to gaming everyday. (Which is only half true. I play games when I can, but I’ve fallen off of it more and more lately, as I have most things I was interested in) 
She said lots of more shit, basically putting us in the same boat. Talking about how laziness is bc “this generation gets too comfortable” or whatever. 
Basically she just called us both lazy and blamed our “funks” on this laziness. 
I took pretty bad offence to it, as I am quite the opposite of lazy. Even when I was unemployed last semester, I was still physically active, and I spent a lot of time doing chores around the house or homework when I wasn’t at school. 
My brother, on the other hand, will come in once a week with a huge ass pile of dishes from his room and dump them in the sink for someone else to do. He wakes up at 3pm everyday. 
I should add, he doesn’t have any mental issues. He got into a lot of trouble fighting ppl in high school and he had to drop out and get his GED. There’s nothing mentally or physically wrong with him, he’s just extremely lazy and gets mad defensive if you try to ask him why he spent all week in bed and didn’t at least make more tea when he drinks the last bit, ya know?
Look, I don’t despise him. I’ve accepted that he’s that way, even if it’s badly detrimental to his future. I stopped caring so much and just focused on my own goals. 
But ever since I heard my mom throw me in with that, I’ve started to realise that that’s probably why she never got me professional help all these years for my depression. She just thinks I’m lazy. 
I’ve gotten so much worse lately and I haven’t cut since I was 16 but I found myself scratching at my arm until it bled and now I’ve started scratching at it when I find myself falling too deep. 
Today at work I realised I’d just been staring at the table below me for an hour straight and didn’t do a single thing. 
I dont know, it’s fucked. I haven’t acted on my suicidal thoughts since I nearly attempted at 14 (mom doesn’t know about that one) and despite telling my mom this week literally exactly “hey, I don’t think I will live much longer if I don’t get some serious help”, she still thinks it’s just some damn lazy crap because I have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. 
She’s never had real depression so she doesn’t get how hard it is to do the simplest of things. 
If anyone’s read this far, really what I’m looking for is just some basic advice on how to get going without anyone around you believing what you have is real. 
I didn’t mean for this to turn into a rant. I’ve just been trying my hardest to be proud of myself for forcing myself out of bed everyday to go to work and school and it feels like she just shit on that, especially when she’s saying this when she thinks I can’t hear. 
I dont know. I’m sorry.",0

I don't remember much because of my dissociative disorder but I'll try my best.
The first 3 days, my pupils were extremely huge and I was pretty high. Not the good kind, but just really stuck.
It was my second AD and I knew they took time to start working properly. So I kept taking it.
During that time I developed extreme paranoia. I would skip classes because I was convinced people were talking about me. I started hearing voices. I started hearing people talking shit about me.
For example, we were walking to te smoking area with my friends and one of them just said ""kill yourself fattie"" 
I looked at her and said ""what?"" and she was just confused, as she hadn't said anything. 
I shut myself off, becoming more paranoid and suicidal every single day. The worst part is that I didn't realise it at the time. I thought it was just my depression/other mental illnesses. My friends were telling me that I'm delusional. I was convinced that they were just trying to ruin my life. 
One day, I decided to kill myself. I walked out into the forest with pills, alcohol and a blade. I was sitting down in a well hidden place with my knees to my chest, in bare fucking mud. I decided to have one last cigarette before.
Shit. I left my lighter at my dorm. So I walked back.
And then I snapped back into it. For the first time. I told my best friend. 
""I'm psychotic, please, take me to a mental hospital. Now. I can't do this. I have no idea what I'll do next, I almost killed myself.""
The next day they brought me in and one of the best psychiatrists in the country INSTANTLY took me off Effexor. 
I can't remember anything about the hospital. Apparently I was so psychotic that they had to keep me on A LOT of benzos and antipsychotics.
My friend told me and I quote ""You were not yourself. Every day you looked so traumatized as if you'd just seen your entire family die in front of you""

I live with my mother and my sister, I'm 20 years old, I graduated from high school 2 years ago and went right into college and 2 terms in, right out into the real world not having pulled through with my education. All of my education (just public school, I don't know anything about private schooling and therefore none of what I'm going to say applies to any form of private schooling) from elementary through to the very last day of high school was absolutely horrible, I had no friends, I was constantly in-between being baker acted, put on suicide watch and coming back to school two weeks later and doing jack s\*\*t at school, whether it'd be because I lacked motivation, because the teachers were incompetent, immature, perverted, inconsiderate, irresponsible, ignorant, entitled grown a\*\* adults (some were an exception) or because I didn't feel like I would amount to anything later in life or because my arthritis was acting up and my hands just couldn't write anymore or because insomnia or just because I was more concerned with making friends and not being alone in the world and in the end the only friends I made were the psychologist and psychiatrist that took my insurance and much more importantly my best friend who's like a brother to me now. I got to college and I was still an emotional kid but I was motivated to move forward with my education expecting college professors to be much better than the high school teacher whose life didn't turn out the way they wanted and to say the least, the professors weren't much of an improvement, so I got mad, I felt cheated and I left to take a break from school, to regather myself so that I could pull through and get my degree and move on and then my funding was cut because I had dropped my last classes of that last term I went through and that's 100 and 10 percent my fault. I shouldn't have let my emotions control my actions because at the end of the day I did what I needed to do to get to college and the degree is mine not theirs but I didn't think of that then and what happened, happened and all I could do is move forward. So I got a job in order to save up money to get back to my education and I quit because I didn't feel that I needed to be taken advantage of the way I was at work, I worked 45+ hours a week for $9.35/hr as a ""Part-Time"" employee, I was offered a promotion as manager and I took it and training for the new position began and after a while I realized that I was just being used as a manager without manager pay, I had already been ""training"" a while and no word of my promotion was mentioned and when I asked I was met with, basically, ""Who tf do you think you are?"" So I left looking for a better job because I know that I was worth more. I put up my two weeks notice and started looking for another job, that was almost a month ago, I haven't found anything and I ended up not saving any money because I had to help my mom pay bills and I have my own responsibilities as well, such as my cat and my car and my phone and my food and hygiene and clothing, so on and so forth. Now I'm an unemployed, irresponsible, childish, completely dependent, college drop-out with no one other than my mom to fully rely on. I've been applying to everywhere and now my mom has a new job with better benefits and better coworkers but she doesn't make a dollar more than I used too at my old job and we're just struggling to get f\*\*\*ing chicken tenders for dinner without sacrificing gas money or internet or rent or electricity or water. I'm overwhelmed and sad and I did this to myself,  I honestly did. Everything that has lead me here was my own doing, that's how it feels and I know the obvious step forward is to get a job, my only problem is how I'll get back to school. With what money? With what time? I can't help thinking how stupid I've been.",0
test_pid_3154,"I finally got meds! : I'm so happy right now since I just got prescribed antidepressants. I know it's a really weird thing to be happy about being depressed enough to need them, but I still am. I also feel that I might get better since medication might help me. And I told my therapist I had lied (thanks reddit) but I didnt tell the truth, I just said I had lied. I didn't specify about what. But I'm still so happy right now, since after years of suffering I finally got medication! 
Yes, this is a very weird post.",0
test_pid_3155,"stuck : i talked to my therapist today and she says i need to ""want to get better"". it's not like i don't want to but it feels like there's a voice in me that says i can't do it. that i have to have depression in order to survive. it even makes me think that i like it. because the outside world is scary. and i've had these sad feelings for so long it feels even comforting now. so how do i move forward and get better?",0

test_pid_3158,"Suicidal thoughts and self harm : I've been on sickleave from work for almost two months now. My depression has changed alot since I first met my doctor.
In the beginning my main issues were that I was tired and sad. I cried alot and I couldn't get out of bed on most days. Now I have more energy and I don't cry as much, but I have way more anxiety, I'm more sensetive to triggers, and I get panicattacks alot. I've managed to push everyone away from me so I have no one to talk to anymore, even when I try to reach out with something positive. Even my sisters have stopped answering my calls.
I feel incredibly lonely and I have alot of anger towards myself. I've started cutting my arms and legs and today I slapped myself and banged my head against the wall so hard that I got a bruise on my forehead. I also threw up two times today because of a panicattack.
I called the suicidehotline and that helped a little bit I guess.
Now I'm lying in bed, trying to sleep, even though it's the middle of the day. I'm worried that if I'm awake I'll just cause more harm to myself. The only reason I havn't killed myself yet is because of my cat.
But it worries me that I've been considering giving  my cat to my sister. I read in an article about how to see signs if someone is suicidal and one of the signs were that you ""give away objects that you like"". My cat is not an object ofcourse, but it worries me because I wanna give her away so I'm free of responsibility and can just end my life without regrets.
I love my cat so much.
I love my sisters aswell, and I understand that they need to distance themselves, but it just hurts.
I feel like I've always been the person that everyone turns to for help, but now that I'm in need of help everyone just ignores me. It hurts alot. But it also shows me my worth, so I guess I shouldn't be that suprised.",0

I have one now who is awesome who I’ve known for years. But for some reason, it’s never worked. I leave feeling like I just wasted an hour of my life. Sometimes I don’t even want to go.
I’m on medication (I’ve been on quite a few over the years) and it does help (especially my mania) but I still struggle a lot with anxiety and occasionally depression. It makes me feel hopeless. Is it true that there is treatment-resistant depression?
I feel like I’ve been pushing everyone out of my life. I never feel like talking to my family, and I ended up ruining my relationship with my best friend. And I don’t even care about it anymore. What’s wrong with me?",0
test_pid_3160,"Need support, not doing well : I have bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, and chronic depression currently with no therapy or meds because I lost my health insurance (USA). I am trying to get back on it and I know what I need to do, so I don't need advice on that. It will be a long process for a few reasons, but that's just what it is.
I failed my bio test in college today. Had to leave a bunch of stuff blank. Have an expensive credit card bill I'm paying down from my car. Working only part time because of school. Money is tight, my family life isn't great, and I've been In a depression that nothing lifts. It's been like this my whole life. Sad for no reason and I can't make myself happy. I feel pathetic and useless for not being motivated to study or do better. 
Mental illness has made college so hard for me. I'm not failing but I'm not doing great either. I'm graduating soon and I feel so useless for not having a higher gpa like my peers.
I need all the money I can get but when someone offered me a shift that starts nearly right after class at work, I said no. I've been asking for more scheduled hours but I feel so sluggish and sad. Everyone at works tells me to leave that stuff and home and not to cry sometimes like I do. When I get sad I get yelled at. I want hours but I feel so drained and depressed today I couldn't force myself to do it.
This is the most upsetting thing to me. I want to be finacially responsible. I feel so immature and lazy...",0
test_pid_3161,"Growing up : My therapist and I were talking about my relationship, and how my partner is kind of my security blanket. She said something along the lines of ""but he's his own entity, and you're your're own entity. You can be there for each other, but you have to be there for yourself."". She knows I didn't have that growing up. Nobody was ever there for me really so how the he'll am I supposed to do it now? I guess we'll be working on that in the future. But after I got home and though about it for a bit I'm thinking I don't want to. Why should I have to take responsibility for myself, when I never asked to be born? I never wanted to be here. And knowing that society is asking me to be here and to cope with being mentally ill, and to do all this work I never signed up for is what's making me depressed I think. I would really rather die than do all this hard work that was just thrust upon me without my consent. I feel like no matter how much of this shit taht I sift through I will always feel the same about it. I just started taking wellbutrin a couple of weeks ago and idk if it's going to help me or not, but I certainly don't feel like therapy is very helpful because I DON'T WANT to do it. I don't want to do the work. I want to feel better, sure. But in the context I feel like it would be easier to escape, as I often do. Into novels, into games, into my art. But reality sucks and I hate it and nothing anyone says or does is going to make that change and I just wish she would agree with me that life is indeed unfair and unjust and I shouldn't have to be held to society's ridiculously high standars of what a person should be. I don't want to do stressfull things anymore. I just want to be happy. I just want someone to ask me what I need and take care of me for once.",0
test_pid_3162,"Keep running away, keep running into dead ends then just running again *life rant* : *NSFW/ TRIGGER WARNING- PEDOPHILIA  AND SUICIDE*
I apologize in advanced for grammatical mistakes and if this is ramblly, there alot on my mind and a weight on my chest. Kind of ranting about life right now. Past 3 years have been terrible. Life in general has been cruel. I'm a 21F, going through a series of changes for the past month. 
We'll just get this life rant over with:
Father: An actual pedo,. Not only did he perform, have me perform and try to have intercourse with his 3-13 yr old daughter ( it's my earliest memory and went on continuously for at the very least 10 yrs) but he also took pictures of me, showed me child porn and had me talk "" dirty to him"". Also an alcoholic who cheated on my mother multiple times, hid money from us in financial struggles, verbally abused my mother and at one point held a gun to her head as I watched and called the cops( 14yrs old).
Mother: knows about pedo father, literally said ""he never did any of that with me"" as if she were jealous, used me as a confident, verbally abused me, physically abused me ( threw me into walls, held me down and spit on my face, hit me where my nose would bleed, kick me in the head while I was on the groud), mostly when I tried to do anything a normal kid/teen would do like go out with friends. Still with my father today knowing what happened and everything he has done to our ""family"". I went to the police when I was 17yrs old because I had physical hand Mark's around my neck and they literally drove me home.
Younger Brother: four years younger. we fought like most siblings but we were there for each other no matter what. I would do anything for him and stand up for him when other kids bullied him. I wanted to adopt him and take him away form that house hold so he could have a better life then I. From all I know he received some physical abuse but not nearly as bad as I. He killed himself when he was 16yrs old (more than a year ago) 6 months before I came home from the military. I miss him every friggin day. I feel as though I abandoned him when I joined the service when I was 18.
Outside family: in there own little worlds. At one point each one of them has expressed their concerns with the household but none of them helped. None of them. But they can all talk/ gossip about it amongst themselves.
My military service was short cut. Due to alot of issues I ran into with drinking, tattoo policies, not able to form bonds with others, forming bonds with the wrong people, annd anxiety and depression being the end to it. Got out as General under honorable condidtions.
Since getting out of the service in April I've had a total of 5 jobs. Not from being fired but 1 not paying me, 2 I was going to school and the hours would not work for me. 3 finding a position in my desired field. And 4 I have recently moved states, trying to get a fresh start.
I move in with my bf(25M) of 2 yrs about a month ago. He has his own issues and sometimes we get on each other's nerves with our separate anxieties but we take care if each other. He makes me wake up with a smile even when everything sucks. He has been the kindest thing for me in these years of torment and change. 
Present day:
Last week bf had to take me to th ER for chest pains that lasted for about an hour. They started to feel more and more suffocating. Ik it was a panic attack. Form whatvidk I was literally petting my cats.
This new job (job number 5) has not been as ideal as I thought it would be. I have e months experience in my field and moved up fairly quickly compared to others I have alot to learn and this they know and I certainly do know. The first week and a half were hell. I feel as though I was thrown into it and given no direction. This caused me alot of anxiety from which I have made multiple simple mistakes that I know better to make. I'm a month into this job now and I'm not feeling better. I've taken a step back asked a bunch of questions and have followed the other employees around to make myself feel more comfortable and learn more. I've gotten a lot of attitude from one girl who has already been corrected from our supervisor for it( she does it when she's not around, and sup. Isn't around alot) . She walks awaybor ignores me when I try to have a friendly conversation. When I ask how to do something she just says she'll do it, then when I press about it she just ignores me or says she'll do it in a different way. I generally am a smiley person I try to laugh and joke with everyone. Most of the time I am disclcluded form conversations that I try to be apart of ( I listen to everyone talk say something, subject gets changes or ignored). My supervisor has talked to me twice about the anxiety caused mistakes and explained to her I'm taking new anxiety meds to help ( I've been on 3 diff anxiety meds that have either made sick to my stomach or made anxiety worse, now im trying cbd). I've talked with the BF and even my mother who both say do the best I can. Which i am.
 Im just am not comfortable with the environment and people I am with its alot slower than my last job and I clean about 90% of the time to make the day go by faster. I've pretty much made the decision that i dont want to work here anymore, it's literally keeping me up at night thinking about dealing with the next day and I'm just miserable being there. I have not taken anytime down since leaving the military I've literally hoped form job to job and finished school. I just dont want to go on my 6th job within a year. I thought about confronting the girl and the other staff but 3 against 1 would cause issues, and maybe it is just me. I dont know what to do. I know what I want to do.... explain i think i need to take time down with everything going on in my life rn, and say I will not be returning ( I'm on a 90day probationary period so it wouldn't effect me so much ) take a week off then look for a job ( I can find them rather quickly due to military background and because I'm a fucking hard worker no matter what I do).... but would it be the right thing to do. 
I apologize for the long post. I've gone to therapy and no one seems to understand the constant battle I have whether I want to live or die, o dont care. I'm just trying to live my life and not let all the other bs that has happened win. I'm sorry for such a long post. This is the first time I've put all my crap out there. I just dont know what to do. I know I can't keep running away from the shit and that's why I'm on the fence on whether or not to quit this job and take some actual time off. I know I'll be okay financially since I'm good at saving money. I always adapt and over come. I'm just also trying to do the right thing. Again I'm sorry for a long ramblly TMI post. I hope everyone on here finds there happiness and has a good mother fucking day ! Thank you.",0
test_pid_3163,"I think my meds aren't working anymore : I got a starting level prescription for an SSRI a couple months ago and I noticed it helping a lot pretty quickly. I stopped questioning why I should be alive and even started to enjoy life. I went back to school and was doing well, but it's slipping now and I don't know what to do. I don't want to be on medication in the first place never mind a stronger dose, but the intense waves of self-disgust, absolute loneliness, zero motivation, etc. (hopefully you know that ones) are back and I feel like I'm slowing sinking back to where I was before.
I'm going to go tree planting in two months and it is known to be the insanely difficult mentally. I've told myself I'm going to do it and it would be a huge let down to myself to back out before I even try, but I'm absolutely terrified.",0
test_pid_3164,"Fingers crossed for two weeks. : Knowing deep down inside that I'm not a good person is torture and nothing can or will change me into being something at the very least, salvageable. I have flashbacks of past things I've done, ways that I've been treated and how I've reacted, and people I've surrounded myself with that have gotten me to this point. I cringe. I cringe deeply at those thoughts. I realize that I'm the problem. I'm the bad influence to those around me. Even as a child, I was someone  that ""normal"" kids with ""good parents"" should not have allowed their child to befriend.
It's been 40 years, and it just gets harder and harder to continue on. Life isn't easy and we all know that. My question is... how does a person go on living and trying to be happy when they know they are a disappointment to everyone that is or feels obligated to be around them.  Living with the guilt and shame is unbearable.
I'm trying to convince my partner of 7 years to apply for a position within his company that will be in the same city as his parents. I think I'm making headway. I'm going to ensure to tie up loose ends. A few days ago, proposed legislative changes were introduced to the current MAID law (medical assistance in dying) in Canada. I am holding onto the hope that on March 12, I'll be able to at least start my application. It's been a long time coming and I take comfort in the fact that this method will be fool-proof. After a lifetime of attempts to get better through medication, therapy, activity, etc. I'm take solace in the fact that I've tried and made it as long as I've have.
I will not have a wake nor a funeral nor a celebration of life. I do not want my death printed in the paper or posted on social media. I do not want a burial plot nor a tombstone. No fanfare. No reminders. How do I go about ensuring I'm disposed of and forgotten quickly?",0
test_pid_3165,"I cut down on meds few weeks ago : I have been seeing a psychiatrist for 3 years. My mom and I often take a journey (5 AM in the morning) by train of 3 hours to go to another town where the main hospital is located. The doctor fixes the day for us to visit him. It causes alot of physical and mental harassment since the trains are very crowded in India. Not only that, but we have to wait the entire day in line (in the hospital) just to see the psychiatrist. My mom never lets me stand in queue to get us registered for the appointments. Instead she does it herself. You won't believe but the lines are always long and the amount of patients that the psychiatrist sees in a day is crazy (maybe because it's a famous hospital around here). 
When I visited him, the psychiatrist prescribed me a anti-depressant named, BUPOZEN 150mg tablets. I have been eating this tablet religiously day and night like a stupid zombie for 3 years. My parents have always forced me to take it daily thinking there is something wrong with me. They aren't even aware that this tablet is a anti-depressant. The doctor never tells us about it. Just expects us to believe him and take the doses daily. I never skipped a day on the tablets thanks to my overly caring parents. It is very painful to take them though for it feels like I'm some kind of prisoner needing constant reminders from my parents to eat them.
All these years, I've doubted if they ever made me feel better but I think I have lost my ability to think after I started taking them. I just couldn't think after taking them. He also had some medication named GPAM that he prescribed me early on when we first visited him in 2017 but later told me to stop taking it  after few months. Since then I have only been adviced to take the BUPOZEN tablets. I googled about this tablet one day to find what they were in 2018 because the psychiatrist never told us what they were and what they did even when I asked him. Later, I discovered they were anti-depressants on the internet. I wonder if I'm so mentally ill that that the doctor thinks I don't have to right to know about my medications (that I'm taking) or does he fear that i will stop taking them after I get to know about them? 
Many times I tried asking him what this tablet was or what it did to me. He always told me that they are meant to increase my concentration in studies. But I never found any increased levels of concentration with it. Instead I have avoided my studies all these years whether I took them or not. I strongly think that he lied.
I even showed symptoms of schizophrenia and some degree of bipolar according to my psychiatrist.  Once, he was even forcing me to get admitted in the hospital at one of the appointments so he can monitor me closely and check for more mental illnesses. He told me that he would try giving me different medicines and observe my behaviour after I took them to find my illness. I didn't agree to it because mental asylums in India look like a haunted building with crazy people all around. They don't even have proper beds for the patients. The place didn't look so hygienic to me. Moreover, it was mandatory for one of my guardians to stay with me 24/7 while you are admitted there to make sure you  don't harm yourself or the others. They make your parents take responsibility by making them sign some papers before they admit you. All of this scared me and to be honest I saw one of the patient in that particular mental asylum whose body was all shaking like a ghost, like he was possessed by something. He was being interrogated by two doctors while his body was shaking badly. They didn't show any empathy towards him. So, I made some excuses telling the psychiatrist that I have exams to give in college which I did have. He got angry with me but had to accept the excuse.
Now coming back to 2019. Few weeks ago, I fought with my mom over something and threatened her that I would stop taking the medications. She apologized and requested me to atleast take it once in a day and we agreed on that. I often threaten my parents when things don't go my way because they are over caring and make illogical decisions regarding my life. My life is literally rotting away and a part of me blames them. 
I think my condition has started getting worse after I cut down on the tablet. I only take it once now instead of twice a day. Should I have not cut down on the anti-depressants? 
I'm very sad and have started getting suicidal thoughts back. I cried few nights after I cut down on the meds because I was feeling worthless. I'm getting back suicidal thoughts and all the crazy things that I used to do before I started taking the meds. 
I'm very confused. Did I take the right decision cutting down on the meds without taking the permission of the doctor? What do you guys think I should do?",0
test_pid_3166,"My Story and Struggles : I posted this in the BPD subreddit, but wanted to post it here as well. 
This is my story and I hope some might understand what I’m going through and have gone through my entire life. Thank you all so much for reading this. I have struggled with extreme mood swings, depression and OCD my entire life. I am just now learning about BPD and think that might be the root cause (of course, I don’t know and that would be for a medical professional to diagnose).
When I was little, I would go through manic episodes of thinking I was possessed by demons. My parents put me in therapy and I guess that seemed to help. When I was 13 or so, I developed an eating disorder. I had a horribly abusive childhood and one of my parents took great joy in making me feel like less than a person. This parent, of course, hated themselves so they wanted me to hate myself as much as they hated themselves. They would project so much hatred onto me and make me feel so pathetic and low and even then I knew that that’s just how they felt about themselves. It botched my self-esteem beyond all hope (at least that’s how I felt). My eating disorder was a way to control my life, that was seemingly out of control.
When I got to college, I began to engage in very risky behavior. I drank to black out and found myself in many situations that could have ended very badly for me. I did all kinds of drugs without thinking anything of it. I would engage in very, very unstable relationships that would often isolate me from any other interactions (other than my romantic partner). I always clung to men who had all the characteristics of my parent who abused me.
I would distance myself from friendships at random, convinced this person really hated me or was going to leave me at some point. I would go weeks, sometimes months without talking to anyone. I have a very hard time grasping any sort of self-identity…I don’t even know if I can trust my own perception with myself. I don’t feel like any of my perceptions are valid. I will go through days where my energy is off the charts, where I am happy and blissful and then at the drop of a hat I am back to so much depression. Feeling void, sadness. Emptiness. There are times I don’t even trust my own behavior, because I look back and past decisions and have to accept the fact that something with my mind wasn’t “right” at the time.
This might be all over the place. But this is my truth. And I am ready to get help.
Thank you",0
test_pid_3167,"How to get over this guilt? : I’ll try to make this short. I had to take an entire week off work. 
My co-parent has bipolar, BPD and was having a manic episode and admitted himself to the mental hospital. He took our children every morning while I was working, and he worked nights (always has) so we never had to get childcare thankfully.
Inconveniently this week, our youngest son had a serious constipation issue and I, as a single mom had to run to multiple pharmacies and get the correct medicine, and do it myself. Which is nearly impossible. What 2 year old wants an enema, ya know?! 
I have anxiety and PTSD from my co-parent overdosing a few years ago, and I had to give him CPR. He was bipolar manic at this time. Since this was happening again, it caused me extreme stress, anxiety and PTSD symptoms.
I couldn’t find a sitter without other people missing work or me paying someone. Which I cannot afford. I also can tell my older boy is wondering where his dad is, so I felt staying home to be there only parent currently, that it was better for us as a family. Not to mention my anxiety, my sons constipation, etc. 
I tried to explain this to my boss and the first time he understood and said if I needed anything to tell him. Then, when I told him I need the rest of the week off to deal with this plus my son being sick, he said “I need to be able to rely on you a little bit. But do what you gotta do and we’ll talk and figure it out Monday.” I could tell he wasn’t happy. 
I feel guilty. This job has been good to me but what I’m dealing with is beyond their comprehension, because I can’t explain without bursting into tears and having a panic attack. He doesn’t understand that all of my coworkers would be asking questions and I just did not want to talk about it, so staying home to collect myself and “wait it out” to see if the mental hospital helps my co-parent so he can see(and I can trust him with) his boys again every morning. 
Should I write my boss an email explaining it? I’m sure we’ll talk Monday but I don’t want him thinking I’m not a good employee. I try my best and really enjoy my job, this situation is just very hard for me. 
I’m having heart palpitations, the shakes, mood swings and depression now dealing with ALL of this. Can anyone help me? I’m embarrassed to talk to this with my friends they don’t seem to fully understand since they don’t have mental illness.

You can understand that every estival time of the year was tough for me. Every time that I had those thoughts, I would judge myself, but I kept the same thought process.
In mid January, I decide to cut gaming from my life and it's been hard, VERY hard. Since then, there is not one day that I don't think about play again. After I stopped playing video games, I was always on my Ipad watching Twitch and Youtube so I asked my mother to hide it so I can do something other than nothing. Because yes, I was doing nothing, I could not even remember what video I looked 1 hour ago.
Now that I cut every unhealthy habit from my life, everything should be good and I could begin to live a ""real life"" you would think and so do I.    LOL   I have a phone. Yes the little thing that you always have on you. Yes, that little piece of shit just took the place of my old addiction without me noticing it.
I started to play mobile games, which I always hated, and been on reddit a lot. When I mean a lot, it's a lot more that you could think of. Yesterday was a pretty sad day and just before trying to go to sleep, I saw the worst nightmare of my life. The REALITY. You have a feature on Iphone that can give you your screen time. Since the beginning of the week, 4 days, I've been on my phone for 44 hours. 44 \*\*\*\*ing hours, it's more than the half of the time of my week and this screen time doesn't count the time I watch TV.
I had a panic attack and deleted every game on my phone. So now I'm stuck inside of my house with nothing to do because I'm too anxious to try something new. Welcome in my infinite circle. Just to reassure you guys, I see a therapist at the moment and I hope to get better.
Thank you for reading me and I wish you a beautiful day
TLDR; I found that for the last years, the only things I did was gaming and watching Youtube/Twitch/Reddit and I didn't have any passion.",0

test_pid_3171,"Depression :  
I've been fighting depression for over 50 years. I'm a Vietnam Veteran but was depressed before my service. I got drafted when I was 18 years old. The war didn't help but added to my condition.
I fight everyday for my life and keep going. I found exercise helps but they are still times I wonder what the hell is life about. I ride a bike, use my bow-flex and walk.
I know how you feel and everyone one else. I found counseling not helpful for me. I found that prescription drugs were not a help for me. I became a drug addict one time in my life and got shot in the head leaving me for dead.
There are no magic bullets. I find a peace in everyone's posting. It is a brotherhood of souls that are sharing. The last time I felt that was in South Vietnam in the 60s.
This group has been more of a help knowing I'm not alone.
I think everyone is different in their treatment. Sometimes , I just laugh it off by watching funny movies or listening to jokes. I became a prankster and found peace doing that. Instead of fighting it every time; I made it my friend. I know, I will never get rid of it but at least I can keep it close to me. There is an old saying: keep your friends close but your enemies closer.
Peace be with all,

It takes so much effort to get the smallest tasks done. I feel exhausted so easily and my head hurts all the time. I’m constantly looking for external reassurance or validation. I don’t enjoy the things I used to anymore. 
I feel like my identity has been marred. The person who used to be so curious to understand and love the world she’s in is sinking further into the depths of being, unable to resurface. 
When did it even get this bad? Each foot I put in front of the other just feels like I’m delaying the inevitable—that I’ll cease to exist as a person and traverse the earth an empty husk devoid of character whose only purpose is to survive.",0
test_pid_3179,"I hate the fact that my anti-depressants make me feel, well, not depressed. : So back in August I finally had the guts to talk to my doctor about me possibly being depressed due to survivor's guilt I got after I beat cancer. I got prescribed anti-depressants and was on the for a few months. After my prescription ran out I decided not to get it renewed because I didn't like the fact that I needed them to not be depressed. 
Flash forward to last week I went to my doctor for an unrelated reason and she asked me how I was doing, and I told her I was eh. She told me she had noticed that I didn't get my refill after 3 months and if I wanted to go on them again. Using my better judgement I decided to start taking them again and that was that.
Fast forward to about 10 days later and when I went to greet my wife when she got home from work I felt totally different. I asked her if I seemed happier and she told me it was probably the antidepressants. Then it hit me that yeah it does make a huge difference, at least for me.
And I hate it.
I like not being depressed. I like being able to focus on things I like. I like that I don't need to sit at my desk playing games for extended periods of time. I have an addictive personality so when I get into something I go into it hard and this time it was an MMO. For the past few days I've found myself not playing every chance I got and instead pacing myself until I felt satisfied for the session. I've found more motivation at work and I'm not slogging through the days. I'm not stressing about money, which usually led to me having panic attacks but as I'm writing this it's not even phasing me. Hell, even my libido has been going crazy this past week. Everything feels like it's better than it was 2 weeks ago.
And it's because of this damn pill.
I'll keep taking it because I know it's for my own good because I've experienced the difference. My doctor doesn't want me on them permanently for now, so I know there's hope I'll be ok in the future. But for now it sucks to know that the only way to fix the way I'm feeling is through medication.",0

Would love to know if there is a possibility to building immunity to SSRI medication. I used to have horrid panic attacks and anxiety, all day, every day. Was put on 10mg of Escitalopram, eventually bumped to 20mg, and have been there for about 4 years. Maybe 5. 
It completely stopped my anxiety. Even I couldn't believe it. But. My anxiety has since returned. And it's becoming just as bad as it once was, before I started Lexapro. So, I plan to speak to my doctor in the coming week and all, but just for my morbid curiosity, has anyone had a tolerance build up to their SSRI? any advice or information is warranted.",0

test_pid_3192,"Nothing has ever worked for my depression : I'll try to keep this fairly succinct. I've suffered from major depression for 7.5 years now (am currently 27 male). It came absolutely out of nowhere and I have never been able to figure out what the cause of it is. For all intents and purposes I was having a good life - great social circle, good relationship with family, doing well in school, physically healthy, etc. But for whatever reason one morning I went to class feeling like absolute dogshit. All of the symptoms you can think of, I got - hopelessness, anhedonia, low sex drive, weight fluctuation, suicidal ideation, etc. 
After about 2 or 3 months of these feelings persisting with barely any days where I felt happy and normal, I decided to spill the beans and tell family and friends. It went okay, but my mom was initially very skeptical about the whole thing (though she eventually came around) and my best friends were supportive, though many acquaintances stopped talking to me.
In December of 2012 I finally decided to seek therapy. It went fairly well, as my therapist was a very kind person, and after about 5 months she finally convinced me to take SSRIs. I was on them for just over a year and they barely made a dent. Felt more emotionless than normal, but it was an improvement. 
I then decided to try a variety of other things as therapy/meds weren't giving me the results that everyone claimed they would deliver. I read a huge 900 page long self help book on CBT. I started doing mindfulness meditation. After grad school I started eating healthier and exercising more. But none of it really did anything long term, just temporary boosts to my overall feeling.
I got so desperate looking for more solutions that I actually ended up doing magic mushrooms just the other day - it was a mostly extremely pleasant experience but 24 hours later, the dark thoughts about suicide returned, so not even shrooms gave me the magic ""cure"" that helped for so many people.
The more I try to alleviate this thing, the more demoralized I become. All these years trying to improve myself and I feel like for every ton of effort I give, I only receive an ounce of results in return. It's getting so exhausting and I simply don't know what to do next. Nothing about the future gives me any hope or anticipation - a new career, a family, a new GF, none of these life goals really make me feel much of anything. All that gives me comfort is sleep, food, music, seeing my brothers every now and then - that's it.
I don't know how relateable this specific story is. I just needed to vent somewhere using a throwaway account. At this point in another 7.5 years I seriously can't imagine myself making any more progress when it comes to this illness. Every passing year I become more convinced that this condition is unequivocally permanent and untreatable.
Anyway, thanks for reading. I hope you have a better day than I will.",0

test_pid_3194,"Another bout of depression, feeling trapped in life : Life went downhill since 13.  Was depressed from the pressure to do well in school and attend a good university. Severely suicidal in my senior year of uni. Now that all these have finally passed (parents still pestered me about grad school &amp; working abroad), there comes the insurmountable challenge of having to work at different jobs that would make me depressed. 
I am fortunate to grow up not having much financial troubles. I am really privileged. My source of depression is mostly from the expectations that people have for me. It is easy to say that ""just do yourself and ignore what others say"". But it is another thing to grow up worrying that your family would love you less because you did badly on a test. 
My second job is depressing. I try to not think and feel as much during the work days. But the fact that I have to work over weekends with no OT compensation, at the equivalent of $40k per year in my country's currency, depresses me a lot. I can't see a future even when I put in so much effort every day. Sometimes I just want to die off during my long commute to work. 
It's Saturday night and I haven't started working on the file that I have to deal with. I spent half a day sleeping in, too tired to do anything else.

test_pid_3196,"First two days on Wellbutrin : Hi guys,
I was prescribed Wellbutrin a few days ago, and yesterday was my first day on the medication. I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I was under the impression that it would take at least a week or two before I started feeling a noticeable improvement. However, in the first day alone, my energy levels skyrocketed and I feel like I've been flying through life. I took the first pill at 7am after being unable to sleep the night before, and soon after fell asleep from like 11am-1pm in an extended nap (not good for me, I know I know). Then, I woke up, and I could already feel a significant difference in my mood. I went to a LAN tournament for video games last night, and the whole time I just felt like I was buzzing. I had perfect focus, I was laughing and joking the whole time, and I just felt like, ""wow, is this how people are supposed to feel?"" After getting home from the tournament at about 12:30am, I fell asleep on the couch and woke up around 6am still feeling fully energized.
I once more took my pills at 7 this morning, and am now about to go to work for a staff meeting, something that I usually would be dreading but right now I'm still buzzing around feeling awesome. I feel like I could do anything I wanted, with activities that would normally feel like ""work"" seeming no worse than how I would spend my free time, and activities that I usually like to participate in with my small supply of depressed-energy seem like the most exciting thing in the world. I literally feel like I could be jumping for joy at the thought of going to work out, or hang out with my friends, or painting some D&amp;D miniatures, or even just playing some video games. I don't know if this is normal, or if this effect could just be some kind of weird placebo, but has anyone else felt like this on Wellbutrin? Should I actually be concerned?
I don't think I've ever felt this happy and motivated in my entire life.",0
test_pid_3197,"Can somebody help me? : I feel like such an asshole whenever I refer to my moods as ""depressive episodes"" because I'm not clinically diagnosed of having depression.
Basically what happens during these times is one moment I feel alright— happy, even— and then I see or remember or think of something that makes everything crash. My whole chest feels like a huge weight had just been dropped on it.
Usually when this happens, I go off on my own and just stare at whatever's in front of me, my head completely blank. If I get tired of doing that, I go to sleep. If I'm in a party or just hanging out with my friends, I just go home out of the blue and sleep. I don't feel like talking to anyone, and I delete all my social media apps so no one can reach me. I also disappear— as my friends like to call it— and don't show up to hang out with them until I have to go to school. If I do hang out with them at their house, I'm either on my phone or sleeping. If one of them talks to me, I pretend I'm asleep so they'd leave me alone.
Every month there's at least a week where I feel this shitty. It typically lasts for about a week or so, and during this period, I think of ways I can kill myself. During the worst ""episodes"", I actually wrote letters to the people important to me because was convinced I'd go through with it. I've got about three notes now. The last time, I even ordered two bottles of sleeping pills online. I never do go through with it because I'm too anxious it'll be all over the news in my hometown, and because I don't want to be a burden to the one who finds me.
I'm writing this because it started up again tonight, and I'm sick of not knowing whether I have a serious problem or if it's all just in my head.
Could this be depression, or am I just overreacting?
Thank you!
[P.S.: My parents won't allow me to go to a psychologist because it'll ruin our family's reputation, and I don't have money of my own to seek for professional help, so I don't have a way of really knowing. I know this isn't the place to find it, but I just need someone to tell me their opinion on whether or not I could be suffering from depression.]",0

My therapist was leaving anyways, and I felt that was a good opportunity for me to break away from, what I felt was, the 'crutch' of cognative behavioral therapy.
I felt good for  2 years, and then school stress started getting to me. Then I got into a relationship, and this became one of the biggest catalyst for my depression coming back. It's my first relationship, some things were expected by the other who was more experienced than I was. It was generally a mess, a mess I hope I have under control now.
But right now I have a severe problem with reaction impact. Every little thing makes me spiral back down to thinking the worst. Or feeling the worst.

On a post where it literally said 'Don't be afraid to ask questions, no question is silly'. I feel somehow so betrayed by that. 
I think I'm not going to post again in that community again... I never saw anybody else treated that way, so I rationalize that I did something wrong and I feel so guilty. Yet so stupid for feeling that.

I know it's bad and i should get help before it gets worse. I know he will be nice about it but The school will have to tell my dad and my dad doesn't even know i feel down, let alone self-harm.

Also its summer soon and It is visible. Also i wear a skirt to school with no tights so it's very risky, wearing a skort in PE is also uncomfortable.

test_pid_3204,"Told my parents and it's only gone downhill from there : Before I start, I'm not saying you shouldn't tell anyone. It can really help, but in my situation, with my parents I knew it would end this way. I'm still glad that I'm starting therapy so please don't use this post as an excuse to keep your feelings bottled up.
I'm 17 and I've had depression for at least 7 years now and it's been really serious. I tried to commit suicide mid last year, still feeling just as shitty now as well. Along with my attempt I managed to fail 90% of my classes and year 11 all together. Honestly it's gotten so bad that I can't get myself to do anything at all, I've dropped out of school because I wasn't going there in the first place, and all I do now is stare at walls all day.
I was never planning on telling my parents. I was thinking of ways I might be able to get a therapist or something without them knowing what I've been through... But as the title suggests, that isn't how it turned out. One day I just got a random boost in confidence that lasted a day and a half, coming down from that made me feel absolutely terrible. One because it reminded me of how terrible I feel 99.9% of the time, and two because during that high I spoke to my mum about this.
Ever since I told my mum I don't feel comfortable around her. I mean I never felt to comfortable around my mum in the first place but it's just gotten worse and worse. The way she talks and acts makes me feel so shitty. And what's even worse is she got me to drop out of school. This pissed of my dad, which then put me in a situation where my mum made me tell my dad, and now I don't feel safe at either house.
My mum makes me feel like I'm very useless with her tone being really soft all of a sudden. And my dad constantly has this tone in his voice and the way he acts towards me suggests that I think of myself as some sort of hero or victim in my story and that I need to just grow up and just act like nothings happening. This couldn't be further from the truth because I am 100% aware that despite the fact I can't control it, I am still responsible for anything I do in this state and just because I have serious depression doesn't mean it's not my fault I dropped out of school, and hobbies, or how I ghosted all my friends, I know that I'm still a stubborn piece of sh*t and that despite hating myself more than anything I manage to still have a huge ego. But what I want him to know is that it works the other way around too, just because I'm responsible for these doesn't mean that I'm in control or that I have the physical capability of just changing in the snap of a finger, I want him to know that my 100% isn't the same as his 100% and that he shouldn't expect me to live up to these expectations just because he managed to.",0
test_pid_3205,"Struggling REALLY Badly : Hey all,
My life is going okay, but I struggle with near constant pain that makes me homebound. I also work from home, but I've been able to do a lot of projects to feed into my creativity and to make a good living without leaving the house, which is, of course, quite helpful.   
I've struggled with depression on and off my whole life, though it was really bad in my teens. Now I'm in my mid-30s and my depression has just skyrocketed. I have a job. I have a great partner of nearly 7 years. I have a family. And still, I am SO depressed. I find it hard to complete some of my work so  I can continue to earn my income, so that suffers when I'm depressed as well.
I'm okay for a while, then I get into these moods where I literally want to die and start crying about how I don't understand why I'm alive and think I'm crazy. 
I should also mention I've had a group of online stalkers for a while now. They don't necessarily interfere with my life anymore, but there is one woman who makes broadcasts about my life nearly daily. It's not anything grounded in reality, just her saying she thinks I've failed at my career (when she says she doesn't actually know what Ido), saying I'm probably miserable in my relationship (and then admits she has no reason to say that, she's just an ""empath"" and knows), etc. I do look at it, for whatever reason. When I mentioned this gets me down to people, they always say, ""Don't look at it."" or ""You know your feelings of being upset about this are valid because she's been doing this for so long, so why do you even mentioned it anymore?""  
I posted about it on a message board and I had to turn it off because I specifically said I don't want to be told to get over it because if I could, I would have already done that. But like 5 people were like, ""I know you don't want to hear this, but GET OVER IT."" Like...wow thanks. Never thought of that before. 
I hope this makes sense. My brain is so clouded and it's a struggle to function. Not sure I'll get my work done to day because I'm struggling.",0

It's relatively a short amount of time but it was really bad. It got better after the first two years, then it wasn't continuative but I would only get medium to long depressive episode. All the episodes were really bad and intense. The last year I had relatively few and short episodes (even tho my anxiety was bad) so I hoped for an improvement but starting from June 2019, it progressively got worse. In September I started having what I thought was just another bad episode. After some months I began to realize it wasn't just an episode and I connected the dots. What I was having for all last year weren't separate episodes. I'm back into depression. I'm not self-diagnosing. I talked to my therapist about it.

I have PTSD, sure, but what I really wanted help with was my depression and social issues. I provided her with information a couple of weeks after my first appointment and a few weeks before the second.

test_pid_3211,"I’m stuck on my own until I become an adult (16) : I’m 16 but I’ve had depression for as long as I can remember. I don’t trust my parents because of the way they were abusive in the past, and when I reached out to psychiatrists I was abused by them for years until I was able to fake getting better so I could get away. They don’t let me have any say in treatment because of my age and I was constantly forced to do things which felt worse. They hurt my physical development with forced drugs and I was locked up for months because my psychiatrist lied and said I was about to kill myself, which wasn’t even physically possible for me.
I don’t have friends at school so being in school and hearing other children being so happy makes me feel sick. I hate how they are always laughing and talking in groups. I have a friend but he lives so far away and I have no hope of seeing him until I’m an adult. Being at school tears my memory apart and the noise and extreme loneliness makes me forget I have a friend at all, which makes everything feel worse. I don’t have any trusted adults around here. My guidance counselor said I have a disorder and told me I need to change my personality. I can’t take a break from school because it’s illegal and in the past I was locked up for missing school due to being depressed, but going to school is wrecking my memory of positive things. I don’t mind being on my own in my house but being alone while everyone else is having friends makes me feel like imploding. Whenever I talk to other children I find that we have nothing in common and they don’t make an effort to listen to me.
I don’t know if I can keep going for another two years. I’m always being pressured to sort out my plans for a career and to make preparations for university but I have no career ambitions and I’m too tired to work on anything. I wish I got a chance to live like all the other students but I was bullied since I was 3 and never even got to start feeling happy.
I just want the constant pain to go away. I don’t know how to get better because all the resources are for adults or children with supportive adults. I take care of myself but it doesn’t get better. I don’t understand why it won’t get better because everyone says you’ll feel better if you eat well and do hobbies and such. I’m stuck and I can’t find any way out of the pain.",0

She recommended this because many kids use the school therapist and we don’t always get a lot of time for our sessions because they eat into my class time. 
This make me so happy because my old therapist quit on me and I finally felt like I was going to get the help I wanted, but everything went to shit.

I've felt like I've been depressed for the past few years, and I turned 18 around 2 months ago so now that I have medical confidentiality, I'd like to start getting professional help. Theres a lot of issues though. I've tried asking for help from my parents to get a diagnoses but they shut it down and refuse to take me to the doctor's. I'd like to schedule an appointment to get a professional's opinion and start a road to recovery but I'm unsure how to do that.

I also cant drive, so getting to a hospital is going to be tricky but I can probably get a friend to drive me or I can take public transport.
I'm unsure as to how all the medical insurance issues would play out and if I were to start taking meds, how I would hide it and get refills without my parents finding out. if someone who knows about this kind of stuff can help point me in the right direction that would be great! also if I were to get diagnosed, how would it look from then on? do I have to do therapy because as much as I would like to, I can in no way reliably get to a therapist due to my transportation reliance on my parents.",0

i know a break up can feel like the end of the world, but i really reached a point where i just wanted to give up completely. like, what’s even the point of trying to be happy when you’re just gonna feel like dying again and again. if life is just gonna be like this, then i’d rather just die.

I tried my first dose of the Venlafaxine this morning and holy hell, it was like torture. Initially it felt like I had taken amphetamines, then came the extreme nausea, the shaking, dizziness, extreme anxiety, I had to take the day off work as I could barely even stand up without puking or getting extremely disoriented. I guess the propranolol was to help with some of that but my doctor didn’t really explain much to me, and I was cautious to use the propranolol as I’ve had a pretty severe reaction to it in the past when I was on sertraline, so I didn’t take any this time.
The propranolol caused my BP and heart rate to plummet, and I couldn’t even stand up without losing consciousness. So I’m pretty reluctant to take it again. 
I’m not sure what I’m trying to get at with the post but I’m very alone right now and I guess I’m looking for reassurance that I should power through this.

I would of rather had her call me to set the appointment not to tell me that it’s gonna be a while! I’ve waited two years to see someone! No wonder people blow their brains out look at these wait times Jesus!,0

test_pid_3232,"Too broken to change what matters : I‘m depressed, suicidal, lonely. General anxiety as well as social anxiety. 
Come from an abusive background, many things happened along the way and I grew smaller and smaller inside. 
I would love to have friends to hang out with. I would love nothing more than to love, feel loved and be loved. To feel comfortable in my skin. To feel safe. Confident. Optimistic. Happy. 
But to change all those things I would have to do things that are impossible for me. I don‘t know how to approach people, especially not a girl I might like. I would not even know how to hold her hand or hug er, or anything closer than that. I‘m scared of pretty much everything, don‘t believe in myself, hate myself more than anyone else. It started over 10 years ago so I don‘t think it will change either. I wish I had the guts to end it and that my family would not be hurt by it. 
Its very late, sorry for the ramble. It just sucks to want something that you are just not capable of. I honestly can not go much longer.

test_pid_3235,"D. A. F. : 
Depressed As Fuck. I've been diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety. Been on different medications since high school.
My wife is going to be getting a new job. I should be happy for her. I'm absolutely terrified. She is going to be the only woman in her department. 17 guys will be working closely with her the entire work day. I know there is cheating in her new line of work. Married or not, it happens. Happy marriages have been shattered, because of the cheating that goes on. She loves the job. She's not going in to it for that reason.
I figure that it's just a matter of time before she finds someone else, someone much better. Better than I'll ever be. Relationship will form. After being with her for 5 minutes, it's really easy to see how beautiful and amazing she is. It is easy to fall in love with her. She deserves better. Someone that doesn't have to take pills to go through the day. Why would she want to be with a mental guy. 
My job is pretty hazardous. Lately, I've been doing risky things in hopes I go away. Hoping something bad will happen to me. I'll often day dream of hanging myself. The hurt is too much to take lately. The nights seem to hurt more. I wake up wondering if today is a good day to die.
How do I tell her my worst nightmare could happen? She doesn't understand my depression. Do I just walk away so she doesn't have to be with a guy like me.",0

test_pid_3237,"It sucks when you try to get help and it blows up on you : Last year, I saw a therapist for about 3 months through my university and it went well. I began this school year hoping that I wouldn’t need therapy, but I became more depressed than ever and decided that I have to go through it again.
This time around finding a therapist to talk to ended up becoming a shit show. I was told by the people working at student insurance that I would get a grant that would cover my school health insurance so that I could see someone weekly. I signed up for it only to find that I won’t be getting the grant due to some system errors on their part. On top of that, the school insurance for some reason did not cover my two visits with the new therapist I was seeing. That’s an extra 2k in loans for me. I won’t be able to see someone until the end of March and I won’t be able to see this person very often. Until then, I guess Imma just have to keep being depressed.
I guess what I’m trying to say is that even if you wanted to get help with your depression or other mental health issues, it’s fucking hard to get that. Insurance sucks, getting help is expensive, and it’s hard to find someone to see regularly. You won’t be taken seriously for depression unless you call a hotline and tell them you’re suicidal. I realize now that a reason why some people is depressed because it’s hard to get actual help.",0

My mom keeps mocking me by calling me ""depression girl"" and my father refuses to acknowledge I've depression inspite of knowing I had attempted suicide a few years ago. I do talk to a therapist but it's not working too well because I know I won't heal as long as I live in this environment. I also got scammed by a few psychiatrists and I cannot afford meds.

But like I said, I've seeked professional help and it's only ruined things for me. I know exactly what can help me. It's love, patience and understanding. But like I said, people around me are too ignorant or caught up with their own emotions to provide me with a bit of reassurance. I understand they have their mess to deal with.

I get that complaining isn’t going to make anything better in the long run, but I think it might help in the moment.
I got out of a relationship of just 6 months about a year ago. It was the happiest I’ve ever been, and I remember thinking how perfect it was the whole time. It wasn’t, she was abusive. My therapist, family, friends, and her old friends all agree. I honestly don’t miss her at all, but I miss how she made me feel like somebody else could care about me, and love me like I love me.
I don’t have bad self esteem, in fact, I have great self esteem, but I do worry that I’m unlovable. I worry that no girl will ever put in the effort to get to know me because there are 20 other dudes who she wouldn’t have to try so hard to get to know. I worry my personality puts off everyone but people who’re so outgoing they already have somebody. I tell my therapist all the time that I don’t feel good enough for what I deserve. 
I guess if I need to hear anything, it’s that she’s out there, that there are girls out there who would really genuinely love me. My therapist tells me I need to meet a girl who’s very open minded, and loves to learn. It’s just like I said, I hope I’m not looking for more than I can ever dream of getting.

In this thread, I not gonna lie, I not gonna exaggerate, I not gonna ask that we cry on my shoulder, I gonna just talk about me, my experiences, my life (if we can call that a life), as objectively as possible and, perhaps, this will makes me feel better...
I was born in 88, in South of France. Before my birth, my mom got the toxoplasmosis.  
The Toxoplasma Gondii is a parasite, a very tiny one, but also really dangerous for pregnant women and their babies. You can caught it by a cat, water, dirt, excrements etc... If a pregnant woman ingest the parasite, it can contaminate the foetus,  and can lead to serious complications (malformations, blindness, miscarriage, Down's syndrome, behavioral disorders ...) . It's actually a quite common thing in France (we are the most contaminated country in the world if I remember well).
I'm not going to describe all the details about this parasite, I'm not an expert, and this would be so long to explain. If you are interested, here is the Wikipedia page about this tiny fucker : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma\_gondii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii) 
Anyway, my parents are both doctors, so they were very concerned by my health when they discovered that my mom was infected. They knew the risk for me, and in the late 80's the treatments were less effective than now, there was good chances that I died at birth, or suffered from deformities.  To give you an idea of ​​the fear they had, they confessed to me a few years ago that they chose my first name only at the last minute, convinced that I might not gonna survive. I never very well estimated until this day because they always tend to minimize their problems, but for once, I knew it was really serious.
Fortunately, I came out whole ! No deformities, no vision problems, no Down's syndrome, a big baby in great shape.  Of course, I got heavely treatemt to prevent the parasite from affecting my health, particularly my eyes which could be attacked by the latter ""resurgences"" phases. They were very afraid that I would go blind. You should know that if you are born with Toxoplasma Gondii, it will infest you until the end of your life. Today, there is no way to get rid of it, because it hides in your cells to protect itself from your immune system, and in general... it is in your brain.    
However, the parasite is what is called ""dormant"", a bit like herpes, which means that most of the time you don't feel its effects, at least theorically.  
However, my apparent good health will later have a direct impact on my parents' vision for this disease, which will lead, by their behavior and mine, to enormous relationship problems. Indeed, as I was in great shape, and that the parasite, although present, had not affected my life, I was never considered as ""sick"", because there was no reason to believe that I was not ""healed"".  During my childhood, they rarely spoke to me about this problem, it was a distant memory, a great fright that had ended, for my parents, in the joy and happiness of having had a little boy.
My mother was nevertheless very attentive to my health, she often took me to the ophthalmologist, to check if I had any problem (the irony of the story is that I have an eagle's vision, with 13/10 in each eye ! But this is not the topic lol).  It's quite common for toxoplasmosis to ""arise"" during the teenage years, infecting the eyes with some kind of inflammation. If these are not treated in time with many drugs, there is a good chance that the subject will lose one or both eyes.  It was absolutely essential for her that this did not happen, of course. 
But besides that, and from my earliest childhood, I had many behavioral problems.  
The first, and not the least, is the TICS. TICS are behavioral troubles that result in repeated and uncontrollable gestures, such as blinking, weird breaths, erratic hand gestures, mouth sounds ... I had it all.  
Also, as far as I can remember, I always had them.  I always had a huge propensity for stress, in fact, I never stopped a single time in my life from anxiety or stress. Later I called it ""the permanent state of danger"", as if my brain was blocked in ""danger mode"" and expected every minute to be attacked.   
From a very young age, I was terribly anxious, by everything, and anything. Every change in my life, every conflict, every frustration, everything was increased tenfold. I had no resilience, I was mentally and mentally fragile, and I can't remember a single day when I didn't had all these TICS on my face, they have always followed me.  It's exhausting, really, and absolutely depressing.  I had absolutely no control over this, I was completely overwhelmed and taken aback by my emotions, I couldn't socialize, be close to others, feel comfortable in society. I only wanted to go home, and avoid stressful situations as much as possible. School was hell, and it never worked out.   
Of course, from elementary school, when you don't react like the others, you are ostracized. This is obviously what happened to me, and even more so at the higher level (between the first and the high school), where it was the apotheosis.  Anxiety slowly became my daily life. And even if I didn't understand why, I was getting used to it. Its consequences were numerous: Few friends, I started to eat a lot and put on weight, I couldn't concentrate in class, my academic results were poor, and I felt like I was constantly tired , without energy, without vitality.  But the worst was to come... 
When elementary school was over, I started having eczema, and not just a little! I had it everywhere, absolutely everywhere, from the genitals to the eyes, going through the toes, it was absolutely abominable.  I spent my life scratching myself, I slept very badly, and I was exhausted in the morning to go to school. With my bulimia and my complete lack of social skills, I had an excruciating image of my body, of myself, and I slowly began to fall into the hell of depression. 
With my entry to college (the school before high-school in France), I started to become aware of this situation, and I tried by many means to fight it, without never succeeding ... Not only I was tired by my brain in a state of permanent anxiety, but I was also tired by my useless efforts to fight it. Getting up in the morning, and that from my 11-12 years, became an ordeal. 
What were my parents doing during this time ? You would say to me, they should have realized it ! Of course they knew it, and of course it affected them. But they were both ERs, which means treating serious and immediate problems, like accidents, ""real"", tangible things.  This was not the case with their son's troubles, which were only ""psychosomatic"". Of course, they could have taken me to see a specialist, a psychologist, but my father was adamant, they are all scammers ! It never works, and his son is not ""crazy"" (ironically, I rather give him right today, I'll tell you about that later).
And then, maybe, if I am not well, if I am so depressed, nervous, anxious, maybe it is simply my fault ? Maybe I should make an effort!  doing sport, eating better, meeting people, forcing myself not to have TICS or anxiety, to have other hobbies than staying on the computer or the console...    
After all, my father said to me, I may have been too brooded by overprotective parents, they should have prepared me for reality, I'm weak, fragile, and now I don't make any effort to get out of it .   
I was maybe 13 yo when he said that too me, and, obviously, that changed absolutely nothing, worse, things got ugly, it was just the beginning of a descent to hell.  
I first started getting beaten up. Mainly by bullies, who found me every day and took advantage of my weakness and my weight to hit me. Then by young people from high school that I didn't know, but who seemed to have passed the word that I was a walking punching ball.  Of course, I replied to these attacks, of course, I tried to defend myself. But 1 to 3 or sometimes 5 ? What's the point ? I losing from the start, and a punch from me was not worth half a flick from them. I spent these years in fear, covered in bruises, terrified of going back to school.
The teachers, of course, didn't give a damn about my condition, they carefully avoided getting involved, and never punished my bullies.  None, also, gave the alert on my school results, none spoke to my parents about my depression, none supported me.  I retain from this today a categorical hatred against the education of my country, and against a system which avoids as much as possible getting involved in the lives of its students. This hatred was born at that time, and it touched everyone, I was starting to lose ground.  But, unlike others, who take refuge in violence, I am a natural pacifist, which pushed me to rather sink into a disabling depression, and the most total misanthropy.
I started avoiding everyone, including my parents.  Sleep had become a comfort in which I threw myself at the slightest opportunity. My parents ended up forbidding me to spend the days in bed, so I spent them in front of the computer (it was in 2002, with the explosion of the Internet and computers).  I did not go out, I saw no one outside of school, I only thought of one thing: to sleep, and to stop thinking. 
 So that in the end, I started to become more and more detached from the world, by building protective barriers so thick that I could no longer touch reality.  This detachment was such that I learned by myself to ""play the normal"",  to give the image of someone ordinary, without serious psychological disorders (even if, often, it was hard to hide). This helped me a lot during high school, where I continued to restrain my anxieties as much as possible, to bury them deeply as soon as they appeared, and above all, especially not to show them to others.  I started to convince myself that no one could help me except myself, and that this mental state was my own personality, that I could never detach myself from it, that I was, of a somehow doomed.
 From this point in history, some people will certainly wonder what connection could there be with toxoplasmosis ? After all, this kind of depression is very common, it's not a parasite issue. Sure, and that's exactly what I said to myself at the time. For me there was absolutely no link between these problems and toxoplasmosis (by the way, no scientist had made a connection either). It was much later, and completely by chance, that I started to really take an interest in the subject, and to glimpse answers to my most intimate questions.
I think I will stop there for now, I will not make more than 3 parts to my testimony, I promise. The fact of writing these lines this morning has already shaken me well, I will take the time to answer your questions (if you have any) in the meantime.  Thank you to everyone who has read it to the end.",0
test_pid_3245,"Getting the correct diagnosis : Currently going through getting my third evalutation/diagnosis at a psychiatrist. It's the third or fourth psychiatrist I'm seeing since I was 16 (I'm 28) and hopefully I'll get something useful out of this.
For the first time since starting on anti-depressants at 16 I'm being taken off of them (with my consent, of course) and I've taken a number of tests with regards to what could potentially be ""wrong"" with me - autism spectrum tests, general mood tests, personality tests regarding any personality disorders etc.
It's been a hellish past 12 years and I've previously been diagnosed with ADD and several personality disorders in the Cluster-C department with depressive episodes scattered throughout the years. Personally, I've felt depressed since around 14 and I've never held a job, barely finishing the mandatory education we have in Denmark (I was absent for most of year 9 and 10 of the mandatory ten years of schooling, barely passing my exams)
I've tried anti-depressants of various kinds and brands, I've attempted cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectical behavioural therapy, seen various therapists and psychologists with different skill-sets and educational backgrounds, positive psychology, hypnotherapy, group therapy etc. with varying results. I've yet to try ""hardcore"" treatments like electroshock therapy or similarly heavy methods of treatment. I've never been sectioned, but I do live in facility with staff and other mental patients (that sounds crude, but it's the best word I have)
I'm beginning to feel like a fraud whenever I see or hear that my depressive ""episodes"" have been mild or that I might be dysthymic rather than depressed. If what I've felt suicidal over has been mild, then how bad can a depression get? If I have days were I can barely get out of my bed or eat proper food, how difficult is it to function at basic levels if you're majorly depressed?
**Anyway** - I'd like to know..how long did it take for you to get diagnosed correctly? And how many kinds of treatment have you tried?
I really need something to reflect my own situation on - good or bad..I just need something..",0
