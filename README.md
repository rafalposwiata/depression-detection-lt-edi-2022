# Detecting Signs of Depression from Social Media Text

This repository contains the code of our winning solution for [the Shared Task on Detecting Signs of Depression
from Social Media Text](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/36410) at [LT-EDI-ACL2022](https://sites.google.com/view/lt-edi-2022/home).

More information can be found in the following paper: [OPI@LT-EDI-ACL2022: Detecting Signs of Depression from Social Media Text using RoBERTa Pre-trained Language Models](https://aclanthology.org/2022.ltedi-1.40/).

## Task description

The task was to create a system that, given social media posts in English, should detect the level of depression as **‘not depressed’**, **‘moderately depressed’** or **‘severely depressed’**.

## Requirements

1. python 3.8+
2. transformers	4.13.0
3. simpletransformers 0.63.7
4. pandas 1.2.5
5. scikit-learn	0.23.1
6. tqdm	4.62.3

## Prepared datasets

We prepared two datasets. The first is a preprocessed dataset provided by the competition organizers.
The second, Reddit Depression Corpora, was used to train the DepRoBERTa language model.
 
### Preprocessed competition dataset

Dataset was prepared by removing duplicates and transfer some examples from the dev set to the train set.
Files are available in the [./data/preprocessed_dataset](data/preprocessed_dataset) folder.

### Reddit Depression Corpora

We built a corpus based on **[the Reddit Mental Health Dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3941387#.Y5L6O_fMKUl)**
(Low et al., 2020) and a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xavrig/reddit-dataset-rdepression-and-rsuicidewatch)
of **20,000** posts from **r/depression** and **r/SuicideWatch** subreddits. We filtered the data appropriately, leaving
mainly those related to **depression (31,2%)**, **anxiety (20,5%)** and **suicide (18.1%)**, which resulted in a corpora consisting
of **396,968** posts.

## Trained models

### DepRoBERTa

**DepRoBERTa (RoBERTa for Depression Detection)** - language model based on RoBERTa-large and further pre-trained on the
Reddit Depression Corpora.
